I. Tryambaka's Introduction 
(Sdhp. 1v. 1-2v. 5) 
Tryambaka opens his treatise with a typical invocation: 'Hail to Gaṇādhipati! Hail to Sarasvati! Hail to (the line) of teachers!'1 Gaṇādhipati, more commonly called Ganapati or Gaṇeśa ('Lord of troops'), is traditionally worshipped as the remover of obstacles. As 'one who causes an auspicious beginning' (mangalārambhaḥ), he is invoked at the start of rituals or other projects. This is how- ever a late development: Gaṇeśa is not invoked in the gṛhya- or dharmasutras. Sarasvati is the goddess of eloquence and learning. 
The text continues with four introductory verses. 
1. 'Obedient service to one's husband (bhartṛśuśruṣaṇam) is the primary religious duty enjoined by sacred tradition for women. When the daughter of the Himalayas (Pārvatī) realized that this duty was endorsed by her father, she put it into practice and so assumed the form (abhajata) of half the body of her husband. May she always show me how to follow the path of sacred law!'2 
Śuśrūsanam and śuśrūṣā (lit. ‘desire to hear') cover a range of meanings and associations from the reverential (such as the Vedic student's ministrations to his teacher and the devotee's homage to his god) to the subservient (such as the obsequious services of the slave). With regard to women, it manages to combine all three and describes the proper attitude of the wife to her lord: obedience in matters of principle; diligent and attentive service in the practical matters of every day. It also bridges without difficulty the apparent gap between religious duties and daily chores: the wife's service to her husband in the home is her worship of her god. Tryambaka returns to this topic in his concluding section where he defines patiśuśruṣaṇam in three different ways (see section V, p. 305). In particular, he argues that the term 'service' (suśrūṣā) covers every-

thing that gives a husband pleasure; that there are clear parallels both with the son's relationship with his mother, and with the 'service' offered by the student to his teacher; and thus that ‘obe- dience' (äjñakaraṇa) is included in the more general term 'service' (suśrūṣā; see section V, pp. 312-13). Abhajata is probably intended here as a pun, for √√bhaj may have a variety of meanings: 'to obtain as one's share'; 'to serve, honour or devote oneself to'; and 'to take on the shape or form of. 
The reference to Pārvatī, one of the most popular examples of the devoted wife, recalls the story told to explain the haritālikāvrata. This 'vow' or religious observance, performed by women alone and especially popular in Maharashtra even today, involves the worship of coloured clay images of Parvati, her (female) friend, and the symbol of the god Śiva (the sivalinga). It is des- cribed only in the later medieval digests such as the Vrataräja of Viśvanatha, the Nirnayasindhu of Kamalākarabhatta, and the Vratārka of Sankarabhatta Ghare (PVK V.i.p.144-5). The story, said to have been narrated to Parvati by Śiva himself, recounts how by her own devotions Pārvatī both acquired Siva as her husband (cf. Nagaswamy 1983:46-51) and attained the honour of becoming half of his body. This half-male, half-female form of Śiva (ardha- nārīśvara) is graphically depicted in temple sculptures such as those in the Elephanta caves off Bombay (cf. Zimmer 1983:vol.II, plates 256,258;139). Similarly, in the umāmaheśvarasamvāda section of the Mahābhārata, Śiva reminds his wife that she is half of him, sprung from half his body.3 
The image also reinforces the ideal oneness of the married human couple: husband and wife as complementary halves of one whole. This is a popular image. In the famous passage from the Bṛhad- āraṇyakopaniṣad (1.4.1-2), the primeval Self in the shape of a man (puruṣavidhah) longs for a second: he falls (√pat) into two parts from which arise husband (pati) and wife (patni). Hence their subsequent union is the reuniting of two halves. Similarly, in Sat.Br.V.2.1.10, the sacrificer includes his wife in the väjapeya ritual on the grounds that she is half of himself and he wishes to go to the 'supreme goal' complete. This much-extolled oneness does not, however, bear close examination. The Upanisadic Self, like Śiva, continues to identify

with his male half, pursuing the female in her various forms for the purpose of sexual intercourse. On the human level, the oneness of the married couple means not the merging of two individuals but the self-effacement of one of them. In the Mahabharata, for example, Gāndhārī adopts not only her husband's lifestyle and interests, but his physical characteristics as well: she binds her eyes so as not to excel the blind Dhṛtarastra in any way (Mbh.I.110.14). As Trya- mbaka's treatise on women unfolds, it becomes increasingly clear that the ideal wife is one whose duties, purpose and identity derive entirely from her husband. In practical terms, as we shall see, this is what is meant by the oneness of marriage. For the goddess Parvati or the ideal woman such as Sakuntala, the whole woman—as wife - becomes absorbed into half the man (ardham bhāryā manuṣyasya; Mbh.I.68.40a). 
2. 'She who desired (only) to gain a husband's blessing long displayed the utmost devotion: (first,) because she wanted to show favour to the world; (secondly,) because it was advocated by sacred tradition; (thirdly,) because it was her father's command. (As a result,) she became one with the body of the Lord (Śiva) whose crest jewel is the crescent moon. May Satī, gem of chaste women, today grant me knowledge in the way of the sacred law!'4 
Sati is the daughter of Dakṣa; that is, Pārvatī in a previous birth. When Daksa insulted Siva by refusing to invite him to his great sacrifice, Sati immolated herself in the fire (Bhag.P.IV.2. 1-IV.4.34; Śiv. P., satīkhanda). Later, when the world was threat- ened by the demon Taraka, it was prophesied that only the child of Śiva and Parvati could destroy him. So, in order to show favour to the world', Parvati set out to win Śiva: first by her beauty, and, when that failed, by her religious devotion. Eventually, Skanda was born and both gods and universe were saved (Śiv.P., pārvatīkhanda; Sk. P., kāsīkhanda; Rām.I; Kumarasambhava). 
The importance of the son at this mythological level reinforces the orthodox view that the wife's main purpose is to be the bearer of a son for her husband's family. As Sakuntala declares, a wife's 'wifehood' lies in the fact that a husband enters her and is reborn

from her. Satī reincarnates as Pārvatī to give birth to Skanda. Whether for goddess or mortal, Manu's dictum holds: women were created to give birth (Manu IX.96). In so doing, they fit into the ordained scheme of things and thus 'show favour to the world'. In the Satapathabrahmana example quoted earlier, the sacrificer finds in this the logic behind the ‘oneness' of the married couple: without a wife, a man cannot be reborn (naiva. . . prajāyate; meaning both 'to beget' and 'to become an embryo') and so remains incomplete (asarva); by taking a wife, he is reborn and so becomes complete (Śat.Br.V.2.1.10). 
3. "Those sacred laws which, when put into practice, bring women unparalleled fame, greater happiness in this world and the highest goal (in the next) are here described so that they may once more be thoroughly understood. At his mother's command (jananī- nideśavacasă), Tryambakayajvan has gathered together those sacred laws relating to women and now proclaims them one by one as they appear in the lawbooks, the purānas and so on.”6 
After mätṛ, jananī is perhaps the commonest word for 'mother'. The invocations and references to Parvati may also suggest that Tryambaka is here (and in the final colophon; section V, p. 317, note 8) identifying his own mother with the mother of the uni- verse. A third possibility is that the queen-mother (räjajananī) is meant. This meaning of jananī is attested by H.H. Wilson, presumably drawn from the examples provided to him by the pandits of Calcutta (MW 1976:411; xi). Certainly, Dīpāmba, the mother of both Śāhaji and Serfoji (both of whom Tryambaka served as minister), was a powerful figure whose patronage of scholars is often cited. In particular, she is known to have com- missioned Raghunatha Pandita to write two Marathi works on strīdharma at about this time: Narakavarṇana and Pativrată- dharma (see my introduction, pp. 20–2).

best and which are for the most part well known throughout sacred tradition. If virtuous women put them into practice, they will attain a good reputation, unequalled religious merit, immediate happiness in this world and heaven after death.'7 
Tryambaka begins his introduction proper by explaining why the rules for purification (saucācāra) are examined first. 'For it is said that “if a man does not perform the rituals of purification, his actions will bear no fruit.”8 In order to achieve results in other spheres, therefore, one must perform these rituals. This is why the rules for purification are investigated first.'9 
It is not entirely clear which sense of sauca is intended here. In its wider sense, as defined by Hārīta, sauca is both external (bähya) and internal (äntara or äbhyantara). External purification includes that of family (kula; due to a birth or death in the family), of objects (artha; such as the vessels and implements in use every day), and of the body (śarīra; in particular the cleansing of the body after urinating, etc.; see section IIA, pp. 71-4. Internal purification includes that of the mind (mānasa), of the eye (cākṣuṣa; i.e. not looking at what should not be looked at), of the nose (ghranya), of speech (vācya), and of the tongue (svādya). In this all- embracing sense, therefore, sauca is the first path to dharma, the basis of brahman, the abode of prosperity, a soothing balm to the mind and so on.10 
But this can hardly be what Tryambaka means. For the quotation he gives here reappears in his section on sauca in its narrower sense of the cleansing of the body after urinating and so on. Certain- ly, failure to follow the requirements laid down was deemed to

have dire consequences. In Mbh.III.56.3, for example, evil and difficulty (in the form of kali) take possession of Nala precisely because he has failed to wash his feet after urinating. But if, as seems likely, this narrow meaning is intended, then Tryambaka is speaking somewhat loosely here: he does not in fact examine sauca before he has dealt with several other topics first. The principle, however, is clear. 
Tryambaka's second point is that the rulings he is about to expound apply only to married women. He argues by analogy with the case for men. Three separate and unattributed quotations are produced to support his statement that 'religious law prescribes no rules for men until they have been invested with the sacred thread (lit. “until the binding on of the muñja grass”).’11 
First, 'they (the lawbooks or lawgivers) place no restrictions on one's actions until the investiture of the sacred thread (has taken place).'12 In Baudh.I.2.3.6, the quotation is completed with the explanation that, until one is born again through the Veda (i.e. Vedic education), one is on the same level as the sudra. Vas.II.6 quotes Hārīta to the same effect. Secondly, 'before initiation, they (i.e. children; in this context, boys) may do, say and eat what they please.'13 This quotation from Gautama implies that uninitiated children are not expected to obey the rules of social behaviour or grammar, or the prohibitions on food and drink applicable to their elders (cf. Bal. on Yajñ.I.15). According to the Balambhaṭṭī, even if such a child touches a candāla or outcast, he need not take the ritual bath with his clothes on that is normally prescribed. However, Haradatta adds that such licence in fact applies only to very young children, those under five years of age, and not to the uninitiated in general who might (according to some authorities, including Gautama himself, e.g. II.1.6-15) remain so until the age of twenty-two. For the Balambhaṭṭī, the crucial age is six.

Thirdly, 'once the teacher has performed the initiation ceremony, he should first instruct his pupil in the rituals of purification, good conduct, the worship of the sacrificial fire, and the twilight rituals.' 14 
'In the case of women, however,' Tryambaka continues, 'marriage has taken the place of initiation.'15 Or, as the quotation from Manu puts it, 'for women, the marriage ritual is held to be the equivalent of initiation, serving one's husband that of residing in the teacher's. house, and household duties that of the worship of the sacrificial fire.'16 It thus follows that, 'before marriage, women too are free to do, say and eat what they please; for the rules apply only after marriage.'17 We may safely assume here that Haradatta's restriction of the rule to the very young would apply to women too. For, al- though Gautama advises men to marry their daughters off before puberty, he also rules that an unmarried girl who has had three menstrual periods may find her own husband. Thus, in Gautama's time at least, a girl might still be unmarried in her early teens (Gaut. II.9.20-1). The Balambhaṭṭī merely adds that the licence given to the uninitiated boy is applied also to a girl, as long as she remains unmarried (with the implication that she would be married by the age of six). Since Tryambaka is concerned only with married women, he does not himself examine the question of exactly when a girl should marry. However, judging by the sternness of his remarks concerning the sanctity of a woman's ṛtu or 'season' (see section IV, pp. 287-8), we may assume that he favours pre-pubertal marriage for girls. Here, he concludes simply that 'the sacred duties he is about to expound are therefore to be performed by women only after they are married.'18

There is a curious contradiction here. Before initiation, a child is considered-for ritual if not social purposes-to be equivalent to a sūdra (see Baudh.I.2.3.6; Vas.II.6): Since, as Manu and Try- ambaka explain, the marriage ceremony is to be taken as the girl's initiation, she too is ritually equivalent to a sūdra before her marri- age. The implication is obvious: a boy after his initiation and a girl after marriage are no longer held to be at the level of the sudra. Tryambaka then explains that all the sacred duties he is about to describe apply to married women. But the next two quotations he cites (one on sauca, the other on acamana) explicitly equate the (married) woman and the sudra. This means that women are ritual sūdras both before and after marriage; the only difference is that they may follow their own whims before they marry, their husbands' afterwards. 
But this is in origin a historical rather than a philosophical problem (see Leslie 1980:15 ff.; 1983(1):99–100). In the Vedic era, the period of study and brahmacarya discipline was deemed essential for girls as well as boys. 19 The reason is important: the upanayana of women was vital to the continuation of the varna system. Without it, all women would be reduced to the level of the śūdra and, as Hārīta explains, sūdras cannot give birth to brahmins, kṣatriyas or vaisyas.20 Although the actual practice of female students probably came to differ from that of males, the fact of initiation remained. Yama, for example, while agreeing that upanayana, Vedic education and the recitation of mantras should be open to girls, advocates that they should be taught only by their fathers, uncles and brothers; that they should not beg from door to door but only from their own homes; that they should not wear deerskins or grow matted hair.21 
As language and culture developed away from those of Vedic texts, more extensive commentaries became necessary, and in- creasingly long periods of study were required to understand the

accumulating literature. But whereas it was acceptable for boys to postpone marriage until their twenties or thirties, it was still thought essential for girls to marry in their teens. The effect was to divide women into two kinds: the 'brahmavādinī (lit. ‘one who discusses brahman'), who was initiated in the lighting of the sacred fire, the reading of Vedic texts, and begging in her own home; and the sadyovadhu (lit. 'one who becomes a bride on the same day, i.e. as her initiation') for whom the ceremony was a mere formality just before her marriage.22 By the time of Hārīta (approxi- mately 500 B.C.), the majority of girls fell into the latter category. The lack of Vedic training for girls made nonsense of their use of mantras, so it is no surprise that by the time of Manu (i.e. at the turn of the era), the initiation of girls was performed without them (cf. Manu II.66, IX.18). By the time of Yajnavalkya (i.e. the first or second century of the Christian era), the upanayana of girls was prohibited altogether (cf. Yājñ.I.13). At some point during this transition-in order to justify the marriage of uninitiated girls to twice-born men and thus to rescue the entire varna system- there arose the compensatory theory that the marriage ritual took the place of initiation for girls. This in turn lent weight to the idea that girls should be married at a very early age. For it was felt that the girl's 'initiation' (i.e. marriage) should take place at the same age as that appropriate for the boy's upanayana. 
It is often argued that this trend was based on the belief that the increasingly long period of study was vital because even the smallest mistake in ritual or recitation could have disastrous results (e.g. Pāninisikṣā 52, cited Altekar 1978:201–2). Although there is undoubtedly some truth in this, the argument is not wholly con- vincing. First, women are not the only ones liable to make mistakes. Now as always, men make mistakes all the time. In fact, after each undertaking, a final ritual is performed that is specifically designed to remove the sin of any mistakes made in the process. There are also special prāyaścitta rituals to cope with the problem. Secondly, according to mīmāmsā philosophy, an injunction or prohibition is weakened if it is thought necessary to shore it up with experiental

reasons. Adrsta rulings are always more cogent than drṣta ones (see my discussion of these terms in section IIA, p. 58 below). Thus to say that Vedic initiation and education are barred to women because they are more liable to make mistakes is to weaken the validity of the prohibition; no reason need or indeed should be given. 
In time, the argument turned full circle. Instead of the absence of upanayana having as its consequence the status of sudra, the a priori sūdra status of women came to be seen as the reason for their ineligibility in the first place. Now commentators had to work hard to explain away the all too obvious references to the upanayana of girls in earlier texts. On Gobh.gr.II.1.19, for example, the com- mentator explains that the term yajñopavītini cannot mean literally 'she who wears the sacred thread' since women may not do so; it must therefore refer to a bride who wears her sari draped over her left shoulder 'like' a sacred thread. On the same grounds, Sankara interprets the reference to a 'learned (pandita) daughter' in Br.Up.VI.4.17 as a reference to domestic learning and expertise (gṛhatantraviṣayam). When Manu declares that no sacred rite may be performed with mantras for women, his first reason is that they are 'weak' and 'impure'; his second that they are ignorant of . Vedic literature (Manu IX.18; Baudh.I.11.7; Mbh.XIII.40.11–12). Śūdra status is now associated directly with the female state and only indirectly with the lack of upanayana and Vedic education. 
Tryambaka evidently has a problem. In order to persuade women of the religious significance of their role, he expounds the view that the marriage ritual is their initiation onto the religious path. But as his treatise continues, we meet again and again the conviction that even married (i.e. ‘initiated') women are ritually equivalent to the uninitiated sudra. Tryambaka uses the first view to inspire women to take their domestic existence seriously, to elevate it to the level of religious ritual, and to discourage them from wasting their devotional energy on other (i.e. non-domestic) forms of worship. He uses the second view to remind women that being female is an awesome hurdle they must strive to overcome. The rulings on daily duties (strīņām āhnikam; see section II, pp. 44-245) follow from the first; the digression on the inherent nature of women (strīsvabhavaḥ; see section III) from the second. 
The problem of how ritual sūdras can give birth to brahmins, kṣatriyas and vaiśyas — voiced above by Hārīta―remains. The 
 
Tryambaka's Introduction 
39 
solution is presumably to be found in the discussions concerning the various ways in which varna may fluctuate. A child's varna is defined by the ‘seeď' (bīja) from which it sprang; and not from the 'field' (kṣetra) in which that seed was planted (Manu X.70-2; cf. section V.9.c). Thus a sudra womb that receives brahmin 'seed' produces a brahmin child. A man's varṇa may be changed by his own conduct. Thus Viśvāmitra, who was born a kṣatriya, becomes a brahmin through tapas (austerities; cf. Manu X.42, Kull.). A woman's varṇa, on the other hand, is defined by that of her husband: whatever her father's birth or her own behaviour, she assumes in the 'oneness' of marriage both the qualities and the status of her husband, merging with him as a river merges with the sea (cf. Manu IX.22-4; X.67). 
Tryambaka's third introductory point is that 'the general rules (sāmānyadharmāḥ) prescribed for men are equally applicable to women.'23 By this, Tryambaka does not mean sanātanadharmāḥ, the code of universal values such as non-injury, purity, truth and good will (cf.Kaut.1.3.13; Vām.P.14.1; Āp.I.8.23.6; etc.). The reference here is to non-specific rules of conduct. 
Tryambaka's argument runs as follows. 'Injunctions relating specifically to women presuppose the widespread acceptance of general rulings (of which these specific ones are the modifications).' 24 He gives two examples. First, 'the wise declare that the purification ritual required of a woman and a sudra is half (that prescribed for a twice-born man).'25 This statement clearly presupposes some general ruling (such as Manu V. 136) to the effect that (i.e. after urinating and defecating) one should purify the sexual organ, the anus, the left hand, and then both hands, by applying earth and water one, three, ten and seven times respectively. Manu V.137 gives the modifying rule for Vedic students, forest hermits and ascetics. Tryambaka's example gives that for women and sudras. Secondly, 'both a woman and a sudra are purified by touching

(water) once on (or in) the mouth.'26 This ruling on acamana, the ritual of sipping water, again presupposes some general state- ment (such as Manu V.139a) to the effect that he who desires to be pure should sip water three times. Yājñ.I.21a gives the modifying rule for twice-born men; Yajñ.1.21b (Tryambaka's example) gives that for women and südras. 
Tryambaka concludes from this that 'rulings such as "he who, rising early, sees. .",27 which prescribe duties for men (in the technical sense that they are couched in the masculine form without any additional modifying rules) are in fact equally applicable to women.'28 This is an important point for Tryambaka's treatise, especially in his long section on daily rites or duties (strīņām ähnikam, section II, pp. 44-245). For, in the absence of rulings specific to women on subjects such as what should or should not be seen in the early morning (darśaniyāny adarśaniyāni ca; section IIA, (pp. 54-7), urinating and defecating (mutrapurīṣotsargah; pp. 69 – 71), or cleaning one's teeth (dantadhāvanam, pp. 78-82). Tryambaka is obliged to quote passages couched in the masculine and assume that they apply to women too. 
But what appears, in this context, to be no more than a straight- forward grammatical point is in fact an extremely significant issue in the history of the religious status of women in India. First, let us look at the question from the grammarian's point of view. Patanjali's Mahābhāṣya (one of the most important works on Sanskrit gram- mar, dating from c.140 B.C.) declares that there are five reasons to study the science of grammar: for the preservation of the Veda; for the understanding of the rules of modification or uha; for the

The quotation is un- grammatical without the previous line: hṛtkaṇṭhatālugābhis tu yathāsamkhyam dvijätayaḥ. Following Yājà. and PT, I have restored suddhyeran (for sud- dheran; plural to include dvijātayah) and sprṣṭābhir (for sprṣṭvābhir; agreeing with adbhir, Yājñ.1.20b). Sakṛt, 'once', as opposed to three times as is the case for twice-born men. Antataḥ is glossed either as antena, ‘at the extre- mity (i.e. of mouth or lips)'; or as antargatena, 'inside (i.e. the mouth)`; cf. section IIA, pp. 75-7.

sake of scripture or tradition; to make one's studies easier; and to remove doubt (rakṣohāgamalaghvasamdehäḥ; Pat.1.8). On the subject of üha, Pat.I.9 explains that mantras are not stated in the Veda in all genders, cases and so on. For the preservation of the true meaning of the Veda, therefore, the study of the rules of üha is essential if one is to make the required modifications to the sacri- fice. By the seventeenth century, however, Nageśa's commentary interprets linga to mean not 'gender' as it clearly does in the original passage but 'the stem (of a noun)' which is only a very late sense of the term. This is evidence of a marked change of opinion between earlier writers on grammar who accepted the üha of gender and later ones who redefined the term to exclude gender altogether. The effect of this denial of the üha of gender on the woman's role in religious ritual is obvious: the majority of injunctions are in the masculine; the modification is not invoked; women are ex- cluded. 
Now let us look at this question in the specific context of a woman's right to sacrifice as discussed in the literature of the pūrvamīmāmsă school. The earliest work of the school is the Jai- minīyasūtra, written perhaps in the second century B.C.. The earliest commentary on Jaimini available to us is the Sabarabhāṣya, written in the fifth or sixth century A.D. Śabara himself is commented on by three different schools-founded by Kumārilabhaṭṭa, (Guru) Prabhakara, and Murārimiśra respectively—all of whom probably wrote in the seventh century. The overall aim of the purvamīmāmsā school was to protect the Veda from the onslaught of Buddhism and other heterodox systems by means of a detailed investigation of dharma as enjoined in Vedic texts. Jai.VI deals specifically with the qualifications necessary for a performer of the sacrifice. In doing so, it considers in particular the two classes of people that came to be excluded from such performance: südras and women. On the former issue, Jai.VI.1.25-38 declares that since the agnihotra and other such sacrifices are mentioned in the Veda only with reference to the three higher castes, the sudra is not entitled to perform sacrifices at all. Similarly, the Vedic texts regard- ing initiation do not include the sudra, and anyone not initiated into Vedic study is a priori unfit to perform sacrifices. Furthermore, these conclusions are endorsed by Sabara and his commentators. 
The case for women is somewhat different. There is no suggestion that women are to be excluded from initiation or Vedic study: 
 
42 
Strīdharmapaddhati 
unlike the sudra, therefore, they are not a priori unfit to perform sacrifices. However, ritual injunctions are invariably made in the masculine form. One question remains. Is this masculine form to be taken as a superordinate (meaning 'person', 'human' etc.) or as a hyponym (meaning ‘male' as opposed to 'female')? Jai.VI.1. 6–20 deals with this very point. The question is raised in connection with the classic injunction svargakāmo yajeta ('he who desires heaven should perform sacrifices'). The purvapakṣa or prima facie view states that since svargakāmo is in the masculine, the injunction applies only to men (lingaviseṣanirdeśāt pumyuktam; Jai.VI.1.6). Jaimini, however, insists that the masculine is intended here in its superordinate sense, applying to the class or genus (jāti) without distinction (aviseṣāt), always of course excepting the sudra. Thus women are also entitled to perform sacrifices (Jai.VI.1.8). 
Let us take a closer look at the views of Jaimini's opponents. They base their exclusion of women from sacrifice on two grounds: first, on the denial of the üha of gender; secondly, on the assertion that the performer of sacrifice must possess property which, accord- ing to them, a woman is unable to do. The latter point is supported by statements (e.g. Manu VIII. 416; see p. 277, note 10) that a woman cannot possess anything because what is hers belongs to her husband or father (cf. Tryambaka's comments on this topic in section IV, pp. 277-80 below). Moreover, she herself belongs to husband or father and is thus 'on the same level as property' (strīnām dravyaiḥ samanayogitvāt; Jai.VI.1.10). Here Vedic texts are quoted describing the 'selling' of a woman by her father to her husband (presumably in the arṣa form of marriage according to which the groom presents the bride's father with a cow and a bull; cf. PVK II.i.516-26; Menski 1984: 2.5.5.). For the exponents of this view, therefore, religious capacity depends on social position, specifically on the possession of wealth which is denied to women (Jai.VI.1.10- 12). 
For Jaimini, however, social position is subordinated to religious aspiration which, he claims, is as strong in a woman as in a man (phalotsāhāviseṣāt; Jai.VI.1.13). His argument runs as follows. First, the crucial text must be interpreted according to the üha of gender to read: 'If a woman truly desires heaven then she too should sacrifice.' She should therefore proceed to acquire the necessary wealth (e.g. by spinning, cooking, etc., or by means of property received at marriage; cf. pp.277-80) in order to perform the sacrifice 
 
Tryambaka's Introduction 
43 
(Śab.VI.1.13). Secondly, since this injunction is from the Veda (which for the purvamīmāmsaka is śruti; i.e. uncreated and eternally valid), it automatically overrules any smrti statement to the contrary (such as Manu VIII.416 cited above). Thirdly, statements to the effect that a woman owns no property, being non-injunctive, are mere arthavāda (i.e. exaggerated descriptions): they should there- fore be interpreted in the more liberal, non-literal sense that a woman should not behave as if she were independent of her husband. If they were meant to be taken literally, then they would contradict the equally valid Vedic text declaring that the wife is mistress of the household property (Jai.VI.1.16; Śab.). Finally, Jaimini argues that marriage is a purely religious function and so cannot be con- sidered a sale in the ordinary sense of the word. This, he claims, is shown by the fact that normally the price of an object fluctuates according to the value of that object, whereas the formal gift from husband to father (i.e. in the ārṣa form of marriage) remains the same regardless of the 'quality' of the bride (Jai.VI.1.15-19). 
In the pūrvamīmāmsā texts, such arguments win the day. For our purposes, however, the arguments of the purvapakṣin are of greater interest. For they provide the basis for the swing away from the religious freedom of women. In particular, the uha of gender is increasingly ignored and ritual texts are more often taken to apply only to men. In all kinds of ritual contexts, the male is invariably taken as the paradigm. When meditations are given on the body or when directions are given for ritual ablutions (e.g. in the Jayā- khyasamhitā), it is always the male body that is described. In theory, a woman can invoke the üha of gender; in practice, it is assumed that ritual information is really intended for the male. 
It is hardly surprising, therefore, that by the eighteenth century, orthodox religion excludes women from virtually all ritual activities. What is interesting is that Tryambaka feels free to invoke the uha of gender when it suits him to do so without any fear of the logical consequences. Presumably by the time he was writing, the issue debated with such feeling by Jaimini and Sabara had been forgotten. The question of whether the üha of gender might be invoked in ritual contexts is now too ludicrous to be considered. In his detailed analysis of the daily duties implied by a woman's religious role (strīṇām āhnikam; see, pp. 44-245), and in the brief section on things to be avoided (varjanīyaḥ; see section IV, pp. 274–6), Tryambaka leaves no room for doubt. 
 
II. The Daily Duties of Women 
(strīṇām āhnikam; Sdhp. 2v. 5-21r.3) 
'Now the daily duties of women are examined.'1 
The daily practice of the orthodox Hindu householder (male) is an important topic of dharmasastra, described in detail in numerous smṛtis, purāṇas and digests (e.g. Gaut.I.5, 1.9; Āp.II.1.1-II.4.9; Yājñ.1.96–127; Mārk.P.29-30,34; Kūrm.P.II.18-19; Sm.C.I.p.88- 232; Sm.A. p.18-48; etc.). For of all the asramas-Vedic student (brahmacarya), householder (gṛhastha), forest hermit (vānaprastha), and renouncer or ascetic (samnyāsin, yati, etc.)-that of house- holder is repeatedly described as the best. 
The asrama theory, examined in detail by Olivelle (1974; 1978; 1984), involves a gradual progression through three main stages of development. In the first, only the householder state receives wholehearted recommendation. The second encourages the notion of a choice between four separate and permanent states (vikalpa, 'alternative'). The third regards the four asramas as a continuous series of temporary states (samuccaya, ‘together'; i.e. in sequence in one lifetime). In all three versions of the theory, however, the householder state is held to be the best. 
The earliest exposition of the aśrama theory is presented by Gautama and Baudhāyana. (For an analysis of the corrupt text into 'Proto-' and 'Deutero-Baudhāyana', see Olivelle 1984.) Gauta- ma notes the idea of a choice in the form of a purvapakṣa (āś- ramavikalpam; Gaut.I 3.1-2), without approval. For, in Gautama's view, the householder is quite literally the source (yoni) of the other three: only he produces children (aprajanatväd itareṣām, Gaut. 1.3.3; cf. Ragh. on Manu VI.87; Baudh.II.6.11.27). Moreover, the order of householder is the one explicitly enjoined (pratyaks- avidhānād; Gaut.I.4.35) in all the Vedas, dharmaśāstras, itihāsas and purānas (Har. on Gaut.I.4.35). Baudhāyana even denies that there is a choice. The notion of four alternative paths is dismissed as a misunderstanding (Baudh.II.6.11.9) or the invention of a demon (Baudh.II.6.11.28). Baudhāyana stresses the importance of family

The Daily Duties of Women 
45 
life; the payment of the three debts (to the seers by study, to the gods by sacrifice, to the ancestors by sons); and thus the urgent need to produce children (Baudh.II.6.11.33-4). 
The next stage in the development of the aśrama theory is shown in the views of Āpastamba and Vasistha. The four orders are now seen to be equally valid in the sense that one may attain liberation through any one of them (Āp.II.9.21.1-2), but they are still mutually exclusive and permanent. (It is important to distinguish here between studentship as a temporary first stage and perpetual studentship as a permanent state of celibacy; cf. Olivelle 1984:85.) Nonetheless, Āpastamba devotes a large number of sutras to proving that the householder state is superior to any of the celibate alternatives (Āp.II.9.23.3 ff.). 
The third stage may be found in Manu, Yajnavalkya and the later smrtis. The āśramas are now no longer alternative states but successive stages, each leading to the next in a steady progression towards liberation (Manu IV.1, VI.33). But still the householder. stage is best (Manu III.77–8, VI.89–90). This remarkably persistent eulogy of the householder underlines the fact that all dharmaśāstrins are, of course, householders themselves. 
In order to fulfil his significant part in the scheme of things, the householder must observe a clearly defined timetable of ritual and quasi-ritual activities, all included under the general heading of gṛhasthadharma, the ordained rites and duties of the householder. 
The day is sometimes divided into two (pūrvāhṇa, 'before noon', and aparāhna, 'afternoon'); or three (prātaḥsavana, morning', mādhyandinasavana, ‘midday', and tṛtīyasavana, ‘evening', cor- responding to the three pressings of soma); or five (prātaḥ or udaya, 'dawn', samgava, ‘morning', i.e. when the cows are collected for milking, mādhyandina or madhyāhna, ‘midday', aparāhṇa, ‘after- noon', and sayam, sāyāhna or astagamana, ‘evening'). Most com- monly, however, the division is into four parts (pūrvāhṇa, madh- yāhna, aparāhṇa, sāyāhna), further subdivided into eight: that is, sixteen divisions covering the twenty-four hours of day and night (e.g. Dakṣa II.4-5; K aut.I.19; Katy. quoted by Apar. on Yajñ.II.1; and even Vidyārṇava's twentieth-century presentation of the ähnika rules, 1979:1). The normal unit of calculation is thus one and a half hours. 
With regard to the different varnas, no specific ähnika rules are laid down for the vaisya or sudra. These men would presumably 
46 
Stridharmapaddhati 
adjust the āhnika rules prescribed for brahmin householders to suit themselves. The ähnika rules for a king are given in detail in Kaut.I.19 (cf. also Manu VII. 145–7, 151–4, 216–26; Yājā.I.327– 33). In the first part of the day (6.00–7.30 a.m.), the king should attend to matters of defence, income and expenditure; in the second (7.30-9.00 a.m.), he should consider the affairs of the people; in the third (9.00-10.30 a.m.), he should bathe, eat and study the Veda; in the fourth (10.30-12.00 noon), he should receive revenue and assign tasks; in the fifth (12.00–1.30 p.m.), he should consult his ministers and consider the secret information brought by spies; in the sixth (1.30-3.00 p.m.), he may amuse himself; in the seventh (3.00–4.30 p.m.), he should review his army; in the eighth (4.30– 6.00 p.m.), he should confer with his commander-in-chief. At the end of the day, he should perform the evening samdhyā (V.9–17). In the first part of the night (6.00–7.30 p.m.), he should consult his secret agents; in the second (7.30-9.00 p.m.), he should bathe, eat and study; in the third (9.00-10.30 p.m.), he should enter his bedchamber; in the fourth and fifth (10.30 p.m.-1.30 a.m.), he should sleep; in the sixth (1.30–3.00 a.m.), he should wake and contemplate the sastra (i.e. of politics) and the duties of the coming day; in the seventh (3.00-4.30 a.m.), he should meet with his councillors and send out secret agents; and in the eighth (4.30–6.00 a.m.), he should receive blessings from his priests, see his doctor, chief cook and astrologer, perform the appropriate rituals, and go to court (v.18-24). Alternatively, as Kautilya adds (thereby undermining the entire system), the king may divide his days and nights as he needs (v.25). 
Although Tryambaka probably intended his treatise for the edification of the women at court (who were presumably of largely kṣatriya families), the ähnika rules it prescribes for women have little in common with the rulings given above for their king. It is thus more appropriate to compare Tryambaka's rulings for women with those prescribed for brahmin householders. 
Daksa, for example, also divides the day into eight parts (II.4-5). For practical purposes, the day's timetable begins in the last division of the night (i.e. 4.30–6.00 a.m.) when a man should wake, perform the necessary ablutions and the acamana ritual, clean his teeth, bathe, and observe the twilight rituals (samdhyā). In the first division of the day (6.00-7.30 a.m.), he should worship his special deity and pay homage to his teacher. In the second (7.30-9.00 a.m.), he should study the Veda. In the third (9.00-10.30 a.m.), he should work for the maintenance of his family, following only 
 
The Daily Duties of Women 
47 
those professions permitted to his varna. In the fourth (10.30-12.00 noon), he should bathe and perform the midday samdhyā. In the fifth (12.00-1.30 p.m.), he should perform the five great sacrifices (pañca mahāyajñāḥ): to brahman (brahmayajña, by the study or recitation of the Veda), to the gods (devayajña, by ritual offerings into the fire), to the ancestors (pitṛyajña, by the ritual of tarpana), to all beings (bhūtayajña, by bali offerings), and to men (manus- yayajña, by offering hospitality to guests). These five observances absolve the householder of the five types of sin committed every day in the home (cf. Manu III.68-71; Vis.Sm.59.19-20 etc.). In the fifth part of the day, the householder should also take his main (midday) meal. In the sixth and seventh (1.30-4.30 p.m.), he should study secular literature (epics, purāna and so on). In the eighth (4.30–6.00 p.m.), he may receive or visit friends and perform the evening samdhyā rituals. From 6.00 p.m. until 9.00 p.m., he should attend to the duties omitted during the day and spend time with his family. From 9.00 p.m. until 4.30 a.m., he may take rest (Dakṣa II; Vidyārṇava 1979:1-2). 
Let us compare these typical basic divisions with the daily time- table prescribed for women by Tryambaka. The first point to notice is that Tryambaka divides the night (and presumably the day as well) into six parts instead of the usual eight (Sdhp.2v.8). This ruling is not specific to women, for the quotation cited is addressed to the householder 'together with his wife' (patnya saha). For Tryambaka then, the unit of calculation is two hours instead of one and a half. However, since Tryambaka rarely specifies the exact times or periods during which a particular duty should be performed, Figure 6 contains a rough timetable demonstrating the parallels between a woman's day as he describes it and that of a (brahmin) man as described in smṛti literature in general. 
A large proportion of the ähnika rulings cover activities to be carried out in the last division of night. In addition to most of the duties prescribed for men, a woman must also prepare the day's quota of rice or millet, sweep the house and smear it with cow-dung, perform the ritual of threshold worship, and attend to the cows. When her husband performs the morning fire sacrifice, she assists him. At dawn, she makes an offering to the sun. In the morning, while her husband studies the Veda and works at his profession, she attends to her household duties. At midday, when he performs the five great sacrifices, she assists him. When he eats, she serves him, eating what he leaves. After the meal, while he studies the

In the evening, while he is visiting friends, she is still doing housework, for the food for the evening meal must be prepared afresh. At the evening sacrifice, she assists him again.

Several of these duties are beautifully illustrated in two palm-leaf manu- scripts in the British Library collection: milking the cows, cooking, serving food to her husband, tending her children, nursing an infant, massaging her husband's feet as he lies in bed, eating the

remains of his meal, and a variety of postures for sexual intercourse (British Library: OR. 11689, OR. 11612; see plates 1-13; cf. Lostly 1980: 14-45; cf. Gaur 1980:23-5). The paintings de- picting children and the wife's involvement with them (e.g. plates 10, 11) draw our attention to a curious omission in the Strīdharmapaddhati: while Tryambaka assumes that the good wife will produce sons, he not only shows no further interest in them, but makes no allowance for them in her day. 
Tryambaka also specifies no time when a woman may simply rest. Indeed, he lists 'sleeping in the daytime' among the six things that corrupt women and which they should therefore avoid (see section IV, p. 275, note 6). Since it is assumed that a woman has no education, it is less surprising that she is not advised to study. Judging by Tryambaka's prohibitions on 'roaming around' and spending time in other people's homes (section IV, p. 275, note 6), we would not expect her to be allowed to visit friends, certainly not on her own. Taken at face value, then, a woman should always be busy about her work. The traditional pattern of an Indian day, however, suggests that the hot period after the midday meal might well be given to rest. It is at this time that women might be en- couraged to listen to readings from the epics or purāņas, or even from a work such as the Stridharmapaddhati (Introduction, pp. 22– 3 and 232-3). 
Before embarking on a discussion of each ruling, it may be instructive to consider at the outset what types of rulings these may be. The crucial question is how each ruling relates to its equivalent for men. The answer takes the form of four quite distinct categories. 
First, there are those rulings which, according to Tryambaka, are exactly the same for women as for men. These include the rulings concerning what one may or may not see first thing in the morning (darśaniyāny adarśaniyāni ca; section IIA, pp.54-7), urinating and defecating (mutrapurīṣotsargaḥ, section IIA, pp. 69–71), and cleaning the teeth (dantadhāvanam; section IIA, pp.78–82). This group of rulings clearly requires the operation of the uha of gender (see section I, pp. 40–3). 
Secondly, there are those rulings which are the same in principle for women as for men, but different in detail. For example, the rules on purification (saucam) are applicable to men and women except that for women the colour of the earth used and the number of lumps required is different (section IIA, pp. 71–2). The rules 
 
50 
Strīdharmapaddhati 
concerning sipping (acamanam) and bathing (snanam) also fall into this category. When a twice-born man sips, the water must touch his heart, throat or palate; when a woman sips, it need only touch her mouth (section IIA, pp. 75-7). A man performs his ritual bath with mantras, a woman without (section IIA, p. 83). Generally speaking, however, both rituals are applicable to women as well as men. Similarly, both men and women must wake early, but the wife should wake before her husband (section IIA, p. 52). Both must eat but the wife should serve her husband and eat only what he leaves (section IIC, pp. 221-7). This is a large group of rulings and the implications are interesting. I shall deal with each in its place. 
The third category, a very important one, consists of those rulings in which the wife assists her husband in his ritual obligations (pativratabhāginī). In the early morning meditation (devatädhyā- nam), for example, the man must meditate 'with his wife' (section IIA, pp. 52-4). In the fire sacrifice (agniśuśruṣā), although the wife has little to do, she must be present for the ritual to bear fruit (section IIB, pp. 132-41). In the ceremony of paying homage and hospitality to guests (atithipūjā), the wife must prepare the food and serve the guest on her husband's behalf (section IIC, pp. 210- 14). These rulings indicate the role and status of the wife in the joint ritual duties enjoined upon the married couple. I shall deal with this in some detail in the section on serving the sacred fire (agni- śuśrūṣā) (section IIB, pp. 107–15). 
Finally, there are the duties peculiar to women. These are pre- dominantly rulings concerning housework, such as grinding grain (section IIA, pp. 58-9), cleaning the house (p. 59), smearing it with cow-dung (pp. 59–63), clearing away after the meal (section IIC, pp. 229–33), and so on. As is clear from the parallel timetable, these duties are to be performed when the husband is studying religious literature or working for the family maintenance. They are thus both part of a woman's religious path and her contribution to the family. The parallel with the man's religious duties becomes more apparent in the context of Manu's dictum on marriage for women: a wife serving her husband is like a student serving his teacher; and her household duties are equivalent to her husband's performance of the fire sacrifice (Manu II.67; see section I, p. 35, note 16). Looked at from this point of view, household tasks become part of the powerful vrata or religious observance of the wife. Hence the high tone in which these apparently mundane tasks are described. 
 
IIA Before Dawn 
(Sdhp. 2v.5-7v.9) 
I shall begin by taking, out of sequence, the rulings relating to the time of waking (prabodhanam; Sdhp.2v.5-3r.3). As Tryambaka explains, 'both householder and wife should already be awake (i.e. have risen) in the final or sixth division of the night (4.00-6.00 a.m.).'1 ‘According to the Smṛtiratnāvalī, it is wrong to be asleep (or in bed) after the brahmamuhūrta: if a married couple stays in bed in the brahmamuhurta, their house is like a cremation ground, shunned by the (spirits of) the ancestors.' 
'2 
Although definitions of brahmamuhurta differ, the general ruling is constant in smrti literature. Rising before dawn is prescribed for everyone from the Vedic student to the householder (e.g. Manu IV.92; Yājñ.I.115; Gaut.XXIII.21). Kulluka on Manu IV.92 defines brähmamuhurta as an unspecific pre-dawn period (kāla- mätravacanaḥ), so called because of its association with Brahmi, the goddess Bhāratī—a false identification as is evidenced by the alternative name 'the hour of Prajapati' (präjäpatye muhurte; e.g. Vas.XII.47)—and because it is the time devoted to Vedic recitation. Sm.C.II.p.234 quotes a verse attributed to Pitämahaḥ defining brähmamuhūrta as the last division of the night (rātreḥ paścimo yamaḥ; i.e. 4.30-6.00 a.m.). Par.M.I.i. pp. 219-20 quotes both Manu IV.92 and Yājñ.I.115 cited above, as well as equivalent passages from the Kurma- and Visnupurānas, and defines brahma- muhūrta as the first of the two muhurtas that make up the ardhaprahara or one and a half hour period before dawn (i.e. 4.30- 5.15a.m.) According to Śrīdharasvamin's commentary on the Visnupurana, it is the third muhurta before sunrise (suryodayat pūrvam tṛtīye muhūrte; III.ii.5), i.e. two hours before dawn. 
A cycle of legends referred to in the Brahmanas explains why one should rise before dawn. According to the Maitrāyaṇīsamhitā (IV.1.9), the gods sought a scapegoat on whom they might 'wipe

off the guilt of the blood-sacrifice. Agni spat upon the waters: Ekata, Dvita and Trita were born. The gods unloaded their guilt on them, and they in turn unloaded it onto whoever was still asleep when the sun rose. This was the beginning of a chain in which each individual, by virtue of his own sin, receives this new sin and then passes it on to another even more sinful individual. According to the Maitrāyaṇīsamhita, the buck stops at the foetus-killer; according to the Taittiriyabrāhmaṇa (III.2.8.9 ff.), at the brahmin-murderer. All the individuals mentioned in the various lists, including the person who is still asleep at dawn, are evidently regarded as being already sinful and thus the appropriate recipients of the guilt or sin of others (cf. Bloomfield 1964(1):521 ff.). 
Secondly (Tryambaka in fact makes this point first), 'a woman should rise before her husband does.'3 A verse Tryambaka attri- butes to Yajnavalkya explains that ‘a woman who lies down after her husband and wakes before him, and who desires no one else in her mind, is held to be a devoted wife (pativratā).'4 This means that, according to the sixfold division of night, a man is required to rise at 4 a.m. and his wife earlier still. 
This attribute of the devoted wife is much praised in epic literature. For example, Yudhisthira's eulogy of Draupadi when he stakes her in the dice game includes in the list of her perfections the fact that she is always the last in the household to go to bed and the first to wake (Mbh.II.58.35a). Draupadi says much the same thing herself in her far longer lecture to Satyabhāmā on the proper be- haviour of wives (Mbh.III.222.23, 36; see section IV, pp. 280–1). Although it seems at first sight to be a minor point, this ruling in fact combines two important requirements of strīdharma: the reverence a wife should show her husband; and her selfless preoccupation with household tasks. 
Thirdly, as soon as she is awake, she should meditate on the (chosen) deity.'5 The rulings on meditation (devaṭādhyānam)

are in principle applicable to both men and women and are described elsewhere in various ways. In fact, the term 'meditation' with all its complex (and modern) associations is somewhat misleading here. It probably means no more than recalling to mind an image of a particular deity, perhaps using the dhyāna verse of a familiar stotra that is specifically designed to aid the worshipper in creating this mental image (cf. Bühnemann 1983:24, 26, 30). 
The Smrticandrikā (II.p.234, quoting Kurm.P.II.18.3) rules that one should meditate on (one's chosen) god; or alternatively (quoting Manu IV.92), that one should meditate on 'the true meaning of the Veda' (vedatattvärtham), glossed as 'the supreme Self' (paramātmā). One would expect Tryambaka to reject both these alternatives when applied to women: the former because (according to his own rulings) the worship of deities is one of the six things that cause women to fall (section IV, p. 275, note 7); the latter, because she has no access to Vedic literature. Several digests prescribe the recitation of five verses from the Vāmanapurāṇa (Vām.P.14.23–7; cf. Vir.A.p.16; Sm.M.II.p.210). Some suggest verses naming in- dividuals whose praise brings great merit (Nala, Yudhisthira, Sītā, Kṛṣṇa, etc.; cf. Sm.M.II.p.210). Others list those who have lived long (Aśvatthaman, Bali, Vyasa, Hanuman, etc.) or suggest the names of the five holy women (Ahalya, Draupadi, Sītā, Tārā, Mandodari; cf. PVK II.i.p.648). Tryambaka, however, ignores even the last particularly suitable suggestion and specifies merely that 'the husband together with his wife should meditate on Hari (Visnu), and then reflect on the requirements of dharma and artha for the coming day.'6 Presumably, meditating with one's husband on his chosen deity is allowed. Yet in his section on widowhood, Tryambaka explicitly states that the good wife may worship Visnu only if she thinks all the time of her husband and not of the god (section IV, p. 300, note 66). 
The latter part of the ruling is to be found in many smrtis and digests (e.g. Manu IV.92; Yājñ.I.115; Sm.C.II.p.234). It is a refer- ence to the marriage ritual and recalls the vow made by the bride- groom that he will fulfil the requirements of dharma, artha and kāma only with his (chief, i.e. lawful) wife (cf. PVK II.i.533). (For a

Strīdharmapaddhati 
modern version of this ritual in which the bride makes this vow, see Menski 1984:11,872.) The requirements of kama have pre- sumably been met by sexual intercourse the night before. In the morning, after the appropriate meditation to purify their minds, they should together consider the religious duties (dharma) and business or worldly commitments (artha) of the coming day. According to the Visnupurana, one should contemplate all three together, as long as neither kāma nor artha conflict with dharma (III.11.5–7). It is frequently stressed that the trivarga, the triple goal of the householder, can only be met through the co-operation of the wife (e.g. Sm.C.III.ii.p.582); hence the wife is the root or basis of that goal (mūlam trivargasya, Mbh.1.68.40; cf. Yājn.I.74). 
This is another example of the third category of āhnika rulings, but one in which the earlier tone of joint participation of both wife and husband remains. It is this aspect of strīdharma that earns the good wife the epithet sadharmacāriṇī, 'she who fulfils dharma with (her husband)'. It is this same aspect of strīdharma that Yudhisthira finds so hard to comprehend in view of the dire pronouncements usually made concerning the wickedness of women. I shall consider Yudhisthira's problem in the section on the inherent nature of women (see section III, p. 268). I shall comment further on the nature of the wife's participation in her husband's ritual duties in the subsection on the fire sacrifice (see section IIB, pp. 107-15). 
The fourth proviso on getting up in the morning concerns 'what one may or may not see (darśaniyāny adarśanīyāni ca) on waking',7 that is, during that crucial first stage of the day. Tryambaka quotes two slokas from Katyayana. The work identified here is included in Jivananda's collection of smrtis, the Dharmasastrasamgraha, as the Karmapradipa of Katyāyana or the Katyayanasmṛti (Katy. Sm.). As the opening verse explains, it is based on the Gobhilagrhyasūtra and is intended as a further elucidation of certain topics covered there. The same work is given in the Anandāśrama collection of smṛtis, the Smṛtīnām Samuccayah, as Gobhilasmṛti (Gobh.Sm.). These particular two slokas, or versions of them, are frequently quoted in writings on ähnika. The Bṛhatsamhitā deals at length with other kinds of omens occurring at dawn, from the calls of 
7. prabodhānantaram darsaniyāny adarśaniyāni ca darśayati kātyāyanaḥ // Sdhp.2.v.10-3r.1. 
 
Before Dawn 
55 
birds and animals to the shapes and colours of the passing clouds (Br.Sam.30). 
The first sloka provides a list of auspicious sights. 'If, on rising early, one sees a learned brahmin, a fortunate man, a cow, fire, or a man who has performed the agnicayana ritual, then one is released from (all) difficulties.'8 For subhagam, ‘a fortunate man' (Sdhp.; Sm.M.; Par.M. preferred reading), there is the alternative reading subhagam, 'a fortunate woman' (i.e. one whose husband is alive; Gobh.Sm.; Kāty.Sm.; Par.M., 11 out of 13 MSS). A similar reference in Par.Sm.XII.47 concerning objects the sight of which is always auspicious modifies gām, 'cow', to kapilā (kapilavarṇā dhenuḥ; Par.M.II.ii.p.34), ‘a dark brown cow'. (In Mbh.XIII.76, Bhisma explains why the kapila cow is more sacred than any other.) Agnicitam may either be taken together with agnim to mean ‘an altar on which the fire sacrifice is made' (cf. PVK II.1.648); or it may, as I prefer, be taken separately to mean ‘a man who has performed the (śrauta ritual of) constructing the fire altar' (i.e. as described in the Satapathabrāhmaṇa). Par.Sm.XII.47 lists agnicit first among the objects the sight of which is always auspicious. The Parasara- mādhavīya takes this to mean 'one who is auspicious (yuktaḥ; lit. "fit" or "suitable") by virtue of the fire altar he has created by piling up bricks (iṣṭakācayanasamskṛtenāgninā).’ 
The second sloka provides the complementary list of inauspicious sights. 'If, on rising early, one sees a very wicked man, an unfortu- nate man, an intoxicating drink, a naked man, or one who has had his nose cut off, that is a sign of misfortune.'9 There are a variety of alternative readings here. For durbhagam, an unfortunate man'

(Sdhp.; Sm.M.; Par.M.), there is durbhagām, 'an unfortunate woman' (i.e. a widow; Gobh.Sm.; Käty.Sm.; see section IV, pp. 298–304). For madyam, ‘an intoxicating drink' (Sdhp.; Par.M., two MSS and the Calcutta edn.), there is martyam, 'a dead (lit. “mortal") man' (Sm.M.); antyam, ‘an inferior man' (i.e. an un- touchable; Gobh. Sm.; Käty.Sm.); and cāndham, a blind man (Par. M., preferred reading). 
Utkṛttanāsikam, ‘one whose nose has been cut off probably refers to the punishment of mutilation. This is noted in A.D. 19 by Strabo (McCrindle 1971:57). Hsüan-Tsang, in A.D. 630-44, records that the violator of filial duty had his nose, ears, hands and feet cut off in punishment. However, since this particular offence is normally accorded a fine in the lawbooks (e.g. Manu VIII.389; Kaut.III.20.18), perhaps Hsüan-Tsang's statement is an exaggera- tion intended as propaganda for his own people (Devahuti 1970: 4-5). Nonetheless, the nose is included among the ten parts of the body on which punishment may be inflicted in the case of offenders of the three lower castes (Manu VIII.124-5; Gaut.I.8.13). In the case of a woman convicted of adultery, Kautilya rules that if her husband is not ready to forgive her, she should have her nose and ears cut off, whereas her lover should be killed (IV.12.30-3). In epic literature, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa cut off Tataka's nose, ears and hands with undisguised relish before killing her (Rām.1.26.11, 17-18); and later Lakṣmaṇa cuts off the nose and ears of Ravana's sister as punishment for her improper suggestions to Rāma (Rām. III.18.21). In the context of war, the Mānasollāsa, written by King Someśvara in c. A.D. 1140, describes four means of subduing an enemy including the janangacchedaka type, according to which defeated warriors had their ears and noses cut off (Vol.I,2.20.1034, 39). Interestingly, in the Marathi expression nāk kāpane, the literal meaning ("to cut the nose') has been superseded by the metaphorical ('to defeat'; cf. Bühnemann 1983:73). Nonetheless, the loss of the nose seems to have occurred sufficiently often for its restoration by plastic surgery to have become the special practice and skill of the brickmaker caste. One such case is reported, and the operation described in detail, by British medical officers in India in 1794: the victim was a bullock-driver with the British army who, being made prisoner by Tippu Sultan, had his nose and one of his hands cut off (Urban 1794:891-2; plate I, facing p.883). 
Before Dawn 
57 
Alternatively, utkṛttanāsika might refer to a deformed nose, or even to a tribal physiognomy considered unattractive to the high- caste Hindu. When Strabo writes of a people 'without noses, having only two orifices above the mouth, through which they breathe', or Ktêsias of a 'deformed' people with 'snub noses', McCrindle interprets these as exaggeratedly dismissive descriptions of Mon- golian tribes regarded by the orthodox Hindu as of extremely low caste (1971:60–3). 'Noselessness' in this context might be no greater deformity than the receding chin of the so-called 'chinless wonder'. This possibility is reinforced by Varāhamihira's section on the auspicious and inauspicious marks of men (puruṣalakṣaṇam; Br.Sam.68.60-2). A conspicuous nose is deemed auspicious: a long one (dirgha), for example, brings good fortune; one like a par- rot's beak (sukasamanāsa) brings happiness. A flat one (cipița- nāsa), however, indicates that death will be caused by a woman; whereas one that looks as if it has been cut off (chinnānurūpa) indicates contact with forbidden women. Whether the nose described is mutilated, deformed, or merely especially flat, however, the sight of it first thing in the morning is inauspicious. 
There is one further point. These rulings on what should or should not be seen are among those couched grammatically in the masculine gender but deemed by Tryambaka to apply to women too (see section I). However, even if we accept the readings subhagam and durbhagām, most of the people listed are men and Tryambaka gives clear directions that women should as far as possible avoid all men other than their husbands (see section IIC, pp. 170–6). One might argue that the modification of gender should be invoked here too but that is not always possible: śrotriya (a brahmin learned in the Veda) and agnicit (one who has performed the śrauta ritual of constructing the fire altar), for example, must (according to Tryambaka's view on the religious role of women) apply exclusively to men. It seems that these verses have merely been lifted out of their original (male) context and reapplied rather less appropriately to women. Alternatively, perhaps the rulings in fact apply to men but are given here so that their wives may take appropriate action. For the knowledge of omens (nimittajñāna) is listed in the Kama- sutra as one of the sixty-four arts a woman should master. Perhaps it is the wife's duty to ensure that the first thing her husband sees in the morning is auspicious.

Household tasks (1) 
Stridharmapaddhati 
Tryambaka proceeds to list the household tasks that must be attended to before dawn (Sdhp.3r.3-4r.4). None of these items are included or even paralleled in the ähnika duties for men. It seems a practical necessity, therefore, that women should rise and get to work before their men. 
In the context of dharmasastra, we should note that rulings may be divided into three major types depending on whether or not the reasons for doing them are apparent. Those that are based on practical considerations relating to this world are said to have a 'visible' or 'seen' basis (dṛṣṭamūla). Bathing in the morning is an obvious example (see section IIA, p.82). Those for which no such this-worldly considerations are evident are held to have a more compelling 'invisible' or 'unseen' basis (adṛṣṭamūla), such as the acquisition of merit that will take effect only in the next life. The number of lumps of earth prescribed for the ritual purification of different varṇas seems to fit this category (section IIA, pp. 71–4). The third type combines both 'seen' and 'unseen' considerations (drstädrstamula). For example, one accepts the prasāda of a deity both because it is tasty (drstamula) and because it conveys merit (adrstamula). Many of the rulings concerning early morning house- work may be seen to belong to the drsta classification. For it makes sense to do this kind of hard physical work when one is fresh rather than in the evening when one is tired. Similarly, in order to get the work done at all, a woman would have to rise extremely early. 
First, 'the grain and so on (required for the coming day) must be prepared in the last part of the night.' 10 Attributing his quota- tions to the Märkandeyapurana, Tryambaka declares that 'all kinds of happiness and prosperity accrue to those women who in the last division of the night perform such tasks as preparing the grain.'11 Kishwar and Vanita (1984:3-4) stress the laborious and time-consuming nature of this work. Grains and pulses must be cleaned and sifted by hand to remove dirt, twigs and stones. Paddy

is boiled, dried, then husked by pounding. Wheat and corn are ground. Even spices are usually ground fresh before each meal. The sounds of this lengthy process of cleaning, grinding and pound- ing can be heard in the dark early hours of morning throughout village India. Sarah Hobson, for example, describes how the women in her household in Karnataka were always up by 4 a.m., grinding the millet for the family's consumption that day (1978:53). A generation ago, this was also common in urban areas where it is now often done by machine. 
Next, still 'in the early morning, the house must be thoroughly cleaned and so on.'12 Tryambaka continues to quote from the Märkandeyapurana: 'If the sun's rays touch a house before it has been thoroughly cleaned, then the ancestors, the gods and the (divine) mothers will turn their faces away from him who owns it.'13 The house belongs to the husband; the penalty is seen to rest on him; but the responsibility for averting it lies with the wife alone. 
Once the cleaning is done, she should smear the floor and walls of the house with cow-dung (gomayenānulepanam). As in the villages and the poorer urban areas of India today, the houses were made primarily of mud. Then as now, the mud surface was smeared with cow-dung to give it the required smooth and absorbent matt finish. The coating was believed to purify the dwelling, in both the medical (drsta) and the ritual (adrṣta) sense. Hence, as the quotation attributed to the Märkandeyapurana explains, 'every day early in the morning, the woman of the house should smear cow-dung throughout the home; once she has done so, she will meet with no difficulties at all.'14 In fact, this task involves a con- siderable amount of work. The dung must first be collected. It is then mixed with mud and straw to form a paste with which major and minor repairs, as well as the required surface finish, may be achieved; and all by hand (cf.Kishwar and Vanita 1984:4).

Stridharmapaddhati 
The sanctity of the cow in general is so basic an assumption in Hindu culture that it is rarely justified or explained. Reverence for the cow is enjoined by the lawbooks: being in a cow-pen is likened to being in the presence of brahmins or at the recitation of the Veda (Manu IV.58); polluting a cow to polluting a brahmin or fire (Manu IV.142); offending a cow to offending one's guru, one's parents, or brahmins (Manu IV.162). In the Mahābhārata, Bhisma regales Yudhisthira with eulogistic praise of cows: they are the mothers of the universe; there is no gift more sacred; there is nothing to equal them; with each part of their bodies they uphold the sacrifice; sacred in themselves, they can cleanse and sanctify others; and so on (Mbh.XIII.79.12–14; 80.2-3, 12). Even in a busy city street today, one may see a cyclist pause to touch a passing cow, then his own forehead, before pedalling on. Reverence for everything relating to cows is so great that pañcagavya, a mixture of cow's milk, curd, ghee, urine and dung, together with water in which blades of kusa grass have been placed, is deemed to purify many sins (e.g. section II.D, p. 244, note 24; Yājñ.III.263,314; Baudhāyanagṛhyaseṣasutra II.20.1 ff.; Par.Sm.XI.28-34; Manu 
XI.165). 
When enjoining women to coat their homes with cow-dung, however, Tryambaka evidently feels the need for some further explanation concerning the sanctity and purifying powers of dung. In fact, he anticipates precisely the kind of reaction that is ex- pressed in the epic by Yudhisthira. The latter has heard it said that cow-dung is 'delighted in by Śrī, the goddess of prosperity' (śriyā juṣṭam), but he has his doubts (Mbh.XIII.81.1). Bhīṣma's response is to narrate the story of how the goddess came to dwell in the dung of cows (śrīgosamvadaḥ; Mbh.XIII.81). Tryambaka's digression in praise of cow-dung (gomayasya prāśastyam; Sdhp.3r. 7-3v.5) is extracted from this. 
Tryambaka's version runs briefly as follows. 'Assuming a beauti- ful form, Śri entered among the cows and said: "I wish to dwell in any one part of you, even in one that is (usually) despised. For nothing despicable can be seen in you, O sinless ones. O you whọ are both pure (in yourselves) and (capable of) purifying (others), O you fortunate ones, grant me a dwelling place! Please tell me where in your bodies I may dwell." The cows replied: "O glorious one, we must of necessity show honour to you. O beautiful one, dwell in our dung and urine for they are pure." Śrī replied: “By 
 
Before Dawn 
61 
good fortune, you have shown me this gracious favour. Let it be as you say and may all be well with you! O you who bestow happi- ness, I am honoured!" (Bhīṣma concludes to Yudhisthira:) “My son, the great glory of cow-dung has now been explained to you." 15 The conclusion comes from another chapter altogether: 'one should therefore not recoil in any way from either the dung or the urine of cows.'16 Tryambaka sums up in his own words. 'And thus it has been established by the experience of everyone that a place smeared with cow-dung is pure, the abode of Lakṣmi.'17 Tryambaka's greatly abbreviated story is clearly intended to encourage women to bring the goddess of prosperity into the house by smearing it with cow-dung. What he omits from the version told by Bhisma, however, is equally instructive. For when the cows first see the goddess, although they are impressed by her beauty, they do not know who she is (Mbh.XIII.81.4-5). She identifies herself as the one whose absence caused the defeat of the Daityas, whose presence bestows happiness on gods and rṣis, and without whom neither dharma, artha nor kāma brings happiness (v.6–8). But when she asks permission to reside in the cows, she is abruptly, even rudely, refused on the grounds that she is unstable (adhruvām) and fickle (cañcalām; v.10). Besides, they explain, their bodies are good enough already; they have no need of her (v.11). Śrī's first response is to bluster. She describes the lengths to which both gods and demons have gone in order to gain her favour; never in

the three worlds has she been so insulted (v.12-15). The cows demur: they did not mean to offend her; however, she is unstable and fickle, and for this reason alone they do not want her to be part of them; and there is no need to discuss the matter any further (v.16-17). Now Śrī is reduced to begging. If they cast her off like this, she will become an object of scorn in the world. They are always ready to grant protection to others, so why not to her? If they rescue her from her predicament, she will always be devoted to them. She is even willing to take up residence in the most despised part of their body, since no part of them can truly be considered despicable (v.18-20). Faced with such desperate pleas, the cows (described as 'naturally inclined to show compassion to those in distress'; karunavatsalāḥ) confer with one another (v.22). At last, they give in: she may dwell in their dung and urine (v.23). Śrī is overcome with gratitude (v.24). The whole tone of this passage and the balance of power implied is quite different from that suggested in Tryambaka's doctored version. 
It is obvious that 'fortune' is personified as a female quite simply because it is held to possess such 'female qualities' as fickleness and instability. As I explain in section III, these are two of the catchwords that describe the innate weaknesses of women. Accord- ing to Manu VIII.77, women have by nature such unstable minds (strībuddher asthiratvāt) that even pure women are not permitted to serve as witnesses in court. (For some reason, the unreliability of the female mind does not debar women from giving evidence in court for other women; see Manu VIII.68.) 
It is equally obvious that identifying the goddess with defect- ridden human women cannot serve Tryambaka's purpose here. He needs the image of Śrī to be glorious and powerful for two reasons. First, he uses her presence in cow-dung to explain and glorify the custom of smearing the house with it and, by association, to ascribe that task to women. For example, it is one of the tasks included in Uma's discourse to Maheśvara on the proper behaviour of wives (Mbh.XIII.134.44; omitted in Tryambaka's extract in section IV, pp. 281-2). Secondly, Śrī must be a figure for women to emulate (e.g. Mbh.I.191.5-6). Thus the truly virtuous wife herself becomes the embodiment of Śrī in the home (e.g. Draupadi, Mbh.I.189.29,33; Sāvitrī, Mbh.III.277.25). Elsewhere, Śrī herself explains that she resides in those women who are devoted to truth, attend to their housework, always obey their husbands, and behave 
 
Before Dawn 
63 
with the appropriate decorum (Mbh.XIII.11.10 ff.). Indeed, as Manu explains, there is no difference between virtuous child-bearing wives (striyaḥ) and goddesses of fortune (śriyaḥ) dwelling in the homes of men (IX.26). It is evidently counterproductive, then, to allow the cows to label Śrī with the same faults as ordinary women and to treat her in the same disparaging way. Quite reasonably, therefore, Tryambaka edits the passage to suit his own requirements. 
In the context of the Stridharmapaddhati, and Tryambaka's insistence that the good wife should worship no god other than her husband (e.g. section IV, p.274, note 2; p.281, note 21; p.282, note 24; p.300, notes 66, 67; etc.), it is instructive to ask what exceptions are allowed, and why. In fact, there are only two, and both concern goddesses: Śrī in this section; and her sister, Jyesthā, in section IIC (pp. 227-9). But neither goddess is being nominated to rival the husband. Clearly, Sri is not to be worshipped in the sense that Šiva or Visnu might be; she is to be emulated. For Tryambaka, she is simply the embodiment of the orthodox belief regarding the good wife. The negative associations he glosses over remain an unspecified but uneasy undercurrent in the complex world of strīdharma. (For the even more ambivalent image of Jyestha, see section IIC, pp. 227-9.) 
The link between the goddess and women is further reinforced in the next subsection. The worship of the threshold (dehalīpūjā) is yet another household task to be completed before dawn by the woman of the house. Tryambaka quotes a series of unattri- buted slokas. 'In the early morning in particular, the threshold is not to be left blank (i.e. of rangavalya; see note 22). If a woman leaves her threshold blank (sunya), her family also becomes a blank.'18 This is a reference to the auspicious designs sketched in white or coloured powders on and around the front entrance by the woman of the house. In villages today right across India, women can still be seen making these often very complex designs in the early hours of the morning. A family that is sunya is one without children. Since in the orthodox view a woman's primary function is to bear children (e.g. Manu IX.96), this is a dire threat indeed.

Stridharmapaddhati 
Tryambaka continues, the quotation. 'The goddess, deity of all, always resides on the threshold. She must therefore be worshipped there every day with the fragrance of sandalwood paste, flowers, unbroken grains and so on.'19 ‘Anyone who touches that threshold with his foot or crosses over it without worshipping it first will find no happiness; therefore one should take care not to do that.'20 'If a woman walks over ground that has been smeared (i.e. with cow-dung) but not marked with the auspicious sign of the svastika, she will lose three things: her wealth (vittam), long life and her good reputation.'21 The reference to a woman's wealth must presumably be understood in terms of the rules set forth by Tryam- baka regarding the rights of women to own property (strīdhanam; see section IV, pp. 277-80). Ground that is smeared with cow-dung but unmarked by the svastika is traditionally held to be extremely inauspicious. It is the custom in Maharashtra, for example, that when a corpse has been lying on the ground, after it is finally re- moved, the area is smeared with cow-dung and deliberately left without the mark of the svastika. Ground treated in this way is thus automatically associated with someone's death (LSJ). Try- ambaka concludes that 'the goddess Laksmī, complete with all her attributes, always dwells in the house that always shines as a result of smearing (with cow-dung) and auspicious powder designs (rangavalya).'22 
Tryambaka now adds the rider that 'this (i.e. all these items of house- work)-cleaning (the house), smearing (the walls and floor with cow-dung), pounding (the grain) and so on—should be done as far as possible by (the wife) herself; alternatively, she may get someone else (such as a servant, daughter-in-law or even junior co-wife) to do them.'23 In support of this statement, Tryambaka

quotes from Sumana's advice to Sandilī on the correct behaviour of women (see also section IV, pp. 282-3). With regard to the wife's general domestic duties, Sumanā explains, rising early in the morning, I do or get someone else to do all the tasks that have arisen for the benefit of the household.'24 
But on no account may the wife delegate her sacrificial duties to anyone else. As Tryambaka declares, 'she should herself attend to serving the (sacred) fire and to preparing the implements required for the worship of the gods.' 25 In support of this statement, Tryam- baka presents a quotation attributed to 'Skanda' (Sdhp.4r3-4) that is reproduced in his comments on devapujā (Sdhp. 12v.5-8, section IIC, pp. 178–80, and again in his section on general be- haviour (Sdhp. 7–9, section IV, pp. 273–4.) I shall deal with it in the most appropriate of these three contexts, that of devapujā (section IIC, p. 179, note 35). It is enough to say here that the virtu- ous wife may delegate her domestic duties to servant or relative (cf. Sinha 1980:116-19), but never her ritual duties. 
At this point, Tryambaka moves on to the rules concerning personal hygiene (mūtrapurīṣotsargah; see below, pp. 69-71). Before describ- ing these, however, I shall briefly consider the rulings given in the later subsection on the care and worship of cows (gosevanam; Sdhp.5v.9-6v.5; plate 1). These are also among the duties to be performed -before dawn but, in Tryambaka's schema, they are sandwiched rather oddly between teeth-cleaning (dantadhāvanam; see pp. 78-82) and bathing (snānam; pp. 82-8). I prefer to include them in this section on general household duties, together with the other points relating to cows and cow-dung. 
Without introduction or comment, Tryambaka quotes what are apparently two passages from the Mahabharata. In fact, both consist of slokas and half-slokas taken indiscriminately either from the Mahābhārata chapters on cows or from verses elsewhere attributed to the Mahābhārata. Most of the rulings are given in the masculine form, indicating general duties applicable to both men and women but here ascribed to women. Their inclusion in

this treatise is probably intended to reinforce still further the link between women, the goddess Śrī and cows. 
The first lengthy passage reads as follows. 'If one pays homage to cows morning and evening, one becomes prosperous. One should always praise cows, not treat them with contempt. One should not be hostile towards cows, even in the mind, but should always strive to make them happy. One should honour and worship them with gestures of respect (namaskārai[ḥ]). For cows are the mothers of all beings and they bring happiness to all. Those who seek success should always walk round cows, keeping them on their right (pradakṣināḥ; i.e. as a token of respect; cf. Manu IV.39 ; Gonda 1980:58-9). One should not kick cows (cf. A.V.XIII.1.56), nor walk through the midst of them. For they are gods in whom good fortune resides and so must always be honoured.'26 'Whether in the hot season, in the rains, or in the cold season, or in any windy or extreme conditions, one should not see to one's own safety without first seeing as far as possible to that of one's cows. One should not report a cow that is eating, whether it is doing so in one's own house, field or threshing floor, or in someone else's; nor should one report a calf that is sucking (cf. Manu IV.59; Āp.I. 31.10.18; Gaut.IX.23 etc.). (Calves are often tethered precisely to prevent them from drinking their mother's milk). If a cow has fallen or become stuck in the mud, one should use all one's strength to raise it up.'27 'Confining and tethering cows for their own protec

tion, however, is no sin: (if the cow is harmed in the process), whether intentionally or unintentionally, this is not to be treated as (the punishable offence of) harming it (tadvadham); and one should tether the animal with (ropes made from) kāśa and kuśa grass so that it faces south. But if one drives a cow into a well or a pond, or makes it trip up on logs (or tree stumps), or if one sells it to people who eat cows, then one incurs (the sin of) harming a cow (govadham). Moreover, there is no prāyaścitta (rite of expiation; i.e. powerful enough to atone) for cows that are killed in a well or ditch, or in a pit with reinforced sides, or in a dammed up river, or in a roadside tank, or in (any such) watering places. '28 
The sin of killing or harming a cow (govadha) is listed first in the catalogue of minor offences (upapātika) given, for example, in Manu XI.60–7. Gaut.III.4.18 equates it with the murder of a vaiśya, Āp.I.9.26.1 with that of a sudra. The penalties imposed vary considerably (e.g. Manu XI.108–16; Yājñ.III.263-4; Vis.Sm. 50.16-24, etc.). However, the statement that there is no prāyaścitta powerful enough to atone for the sin of govadha conflicts with the traditional view that every 'sin' or mistake is matched by a given prāyaścitta (cf. Gonda 1980:288 ff.). This issue becomes especially significant in Tryambaka's discussion of sahagamana (see pp. 291– 8). 
The second passage, also consisting of slokas taken out of sequence from different chapters of the Mahabharata, begins by describing the form that the daily worship of cows should take. 'One should purify oneself and then, standing among the cows, one should repeat in one's mind the gomatīmantra: “I always see the cows. May the cows always see me! The cows belong to us and we belong to them. Where the cows are there we are also. I bow my head in worship to the cow for she is the mother of the past and the future and by her the whole universe of moving and unmoving things is pervaded." One should neither go to sleep without praising cows nor get up without remembering them.

Strīdharmapaddhati 
If one pays homage to cows morning and evening, one becomes prosperous. If a man (naraḥ) praises cows in this way both day and night, in rough times or smooth, and even in times of great fear (or danger), he will be freed from (that) fear (or danger). If one wants a son, one obtains a son; the same goes for wealth too; a woman who wants sexual pleasure will gain a husband; indeed men (mānavaḥ, superordinate) may obtain whatever they desire. Men (mānavaḥ, hyponym) who are devoted to cows obtain whatever they desire; and women who are devoted to cows obtain their desire (too). Indeed, O Bhārata, nothing is hard to obtain for one devoted to cows!'29 
Devotion to cows is thus another pre-dawn ähnika duty. It is to be observed by women as well as men. If a woman wants a son, or marital happiness, or anything else, she has only to devote herself to the care and worship of cows. In more general terms, the care of cows by the higher castes is held to be of great merit precisely because it is dirty work that servants can be called upon to do. It is thus an important ritual act, especially in south India. It seems likely, however, that these rulings are intended not so much for the older established woman of the household but for her new daughter(s)-in-law. We may also note that the recitation of the gomatīmantra constitutes an exception to Tryambaka's blanket prohibition on mantras for women (e.g. section V, p. 278, notes 7-8) presumably because it is not from a Vedic text.

Ablutions, etc. (Sdhp.4r.4-7v.9) 
Urinating and defecating (mūtrapurīṣotsargaḥ; Sdhp.4r.4–4v.3). First, what is the ritual significance of this? Tryambaka explains that, before performing any religious ritual, 'it is necessary to urinate and so on because one who has not done so is not entitled to participate in religious ritual.' The proof of this is to be found in the unattributed statement that ‘one who has held back (urine and excrement) should not perform a ritual.'30 This ruling recalls the ayurvedic distinction between urges which should be suppressed (greed, grief, fear, anger, etc.) and those which should not (natural urges relating to urine, faeces, semen, vomiting, sneezing and so on). Caraka devotes a subsection to this topic, beginning with the importance of not withholding urine and faeces (na vegān dhārayed dhīmāñ jātān mūtrapurīṣayoḥ). He proceeds to deal with each urge in turn, listing the ailments that result from suppressing it and the remedies to counteract them (Car.I.VII). The ritual con- sequences, however, are ignored. 
Secondly, Tryambaka describes the 'appropriate place' where, according to Āpastamba, this should be done. 'One should urinate and defecate far from one's house, either to the south (the direction of Yama) or to the south-west (that of Nirṛti; cf. Gonda 1980: 52-7).'31 But, according to a quotation attributed vaguely to 'tradi- tional teaching' (smaraṇāt), 'this applies (only) to the daytime.' For practical purposes, 'daytime' here includes the early pre-dawn

The latter reading is probably influenced by the better-known sloka from Manu that begins: dūrād ava- sathām mūtram ...(Manu IV.151; Sm.M.II.p.211; Par.M.I.i.p.224; Sm.C. II.p.237).

hours of morning (strictly speaking, the last division of the night). 'For it is said that one should urinate and defecate near one's house at night.'32 
For the details of how it should be done, Tryambaka turns to Angiras. ‘Rising in the last division of night, one should sip water and cover the ground with grass. Then, in a clean place, with concen- trated mind, covering one's head with one's garment, and resolutely refraining from speech, spitting and breathing (out), one should urinate and defecate.'33 As for why one should not speak, spit or breathe out, the answer is presumably ‘unseen merit' (adṛṣṭārtha), the stock answer when the reason for a ruling is not obvious (see p. 58). 
"The rule concerning the direction one should face at the various times' is provided by Gautama. 'One should urinate and defecate while facing north during the day and at dawn and dusk, but facing south at night.'34 There are in fact a number of other rulings that Tryambaka might have given instead. Yama, for example suggests facing west in the first part of the day, east in the next, north at midday, and south at night. Devala opts for facing north in the morning, south in the evening; or, as Manu phrases it, north in the daytime and south at night (Sm.C.II.p. 236-7). However all seem to agree that the two twilight periods of dawn and dusk should if possible be avoided, always bearing in mind that one should never obstruct these calls of nature, 35 
Finally, Gautama provides a list of the specific places where one should neither urinate nor defecate: 'on ashes, on cow-dung (karī-

Ap.1.30.16; one may urinate on one's own shadow, v.17), on the road, or in (any other) desirable places.'36 Moreover, ‘one should not void urine, excrement or any other impurity while facing the wind, fire, a brahmin, water, (the image of) a deity, or a cow.'37 The other 'impurities', listed as twelve in Manu V.135 (cf. Sm.C.II.p. 250), include semen, blood, mucus, phlegm, tears and sweat. The Visnu- purāna (as quoted by Sm.C.II.p.239) includes women among the things or people one should not face at such a time, along with the wind, fire, the moon, the sun, one's guru, and a brahmin. 
Clearly none of the rulings given by Tryambaka concerning mūtrapurīṣotsarga are gender specific. He has simply taken rules originally intended for men and applied them to women too. 
Cleansing rituals (saucam; Sdhp.4v.3-5r.4) 
'One should cleanse oneself immediately', a process defined by Tryambaka as 'causing both smell and trace to be removed'. 38 Two verses from Gautama repeat this definition of saucam. ‘Cleans- ing in the sense of removing all trace and smell of impurity is ach- ieved by using first earth and then water.'39 Manu adds that as long as smell or trace remain, one must continue to apply earth and water (V.126; cf.Yajñ.I.17). 
For 'the earth appropriate to women' (strīnām mr [d]), Tryambaka turns to Marici. 'In the case of women and südras, black (earth is to be used).'40 This rule amplifies Marici's statement (quoted in Sm.C.II.p.242) that different coloured earth is appropriate for each varna: white for brahmins, red for kṣatriyas, yellow for vaiśyas, and black for sudras. It is no surprise that women of all varnas

are grouped with śūdras here. However, ‘if one is unable to find the particular earth prescribed'—in Mahabaleshwar, for example, the earth is predominantly red; around Pune, predominantly black-then 'any kind will do.' As Tryambaka and Manu declare, 'whatever water or earth is to be found in a given place, that is recommended and with that the cleansing should be done.'41 The Smrticandrikā modifies this statement further by listing all the places from which one may not take earth for this purpose: from rat-infested ground, molehills, a road (Yama); earth contain- ing fire, grain husks, insects, bones (Devala); from an anthill, from water, from a house, from cultivated land (Vis.P.); and so on (Sm.C.II.p. 242-3). But none of these rulings are in any way exclusive to women. 
For the rules concerning which hand to use (hastaniyama[h]), Tryambaka consults Devala. 'One who knows dharma should not use his right hand for cleansing his lower body; equally he should not cleanse above his navel with his left hand.'42 
For the amount of earth to be used each time (mṛiparimāṇam), Tryambaka quotes Sātātapa. 'The morsels (of food) prescribed for the induvrata are the size of ripe (lit. 'moist' or 'juicy') āmalaka fruit, as are all oblations and also the lumps of earth used for cleansing oneself.'43 The induvrata or 'moon ritual' (also called cāndrāyaṇa) is a particular kind of controlled fast that lasts for thirty days and in the course of which the amount of food eaten reflects the waxing and waning of the moon. (The yavamadhya form begins with one morsel of food, increases by a morsel per day until the fifteenth day, and returns to one, thus being fat in the middle like a barley corn (yava). The pipīlikamadhya form begins

with fifteen morsels, decreases to one on the fifteenth day, and then works back to fifteen, thus being thin in the middle like an ant (pipīlika; cf. Baudh.III.8.33; Mit. on Yājñ.III.323; Manu XI.217– 18; Vas.23.45,27.21; Vis.Sm. 47.5-6.) · 
Šātātapa also provides the reference for the number of lumps of earth to be used (mṛtsāmkhy[ā]). 'Cleansing urine is reckoned to take one lump of earth for the penis, three for the left hand, two more for both hands; and cleansing faeces, twice as many. In the case of women and sudras, however, half as many is recommended by the wise.' 44 The mention of the male organ (linga) demonstrates the male reference of the original ruling. Moreover, the Smṛtican- drikā version concludes with a ruling related to the voiding of semen not faeces. The last half-sloka is the first of the two examples of rulings specific to women discussed by Tryambaka in his introduc- tory section (see section I, p. 39, note 25). Both the Smṛtyartha- sāra (p. 19) and Dakṣa (V.12) add that half of the sauca require- ments are necessary at night; a quarter if one is sick; an eighth if one is on a journey; and that no particular number is prescribed for women, sūdras, and boys who have not yet undergone the upanayana ritual. This recalls my discussion above of the incon- sistency entailed in equating on the one hand women in general with sūdras, and on the other unmarried women with uninitiated high-caste boys (section I, pp. 34–9). This example, in which women whether married or not are grouped together with both sudras and uninitiated high-caste boys, merely adds to the confusion. 
For the order in which the cleansing process should be carried out (krama[ḥ]), Tryambaka quotes Vyasa. 'First, one should cleanse oneself of faecal matter, then of urine; next, one should cleanse one's feet, and after that one's hands.'45

Finally, we return to the point at which Tryambaka began in his introduction. The unattributed and partial quotation given there (section I, note 8) is now attributed to Baudhāyana and given in full. It concerns 'the problem caused by not performing the purifica- tion rituals described'. 'One must make a constant effort to cleanse oneself (properly), for only then is one essentially pure, a (true) dvija; if one fails to perform these rituals of purification, then one's actions will bear no fruit.'46 The confusion about the status of women is very obvious here. In order to apply the ruling to women, we must invoke the ūha of gender. But the exhortation is to behave like a true dvija and women are repeatedly classed with sudras. It seems that women are meant to be inspired in one place, humbled in the next, but are certainly never expected to think the matter through. As to what is meant by 'proper cleansing', Mit. on Yājñ.1.17 gives the most sensible answer: one need only use as much earth and water as is necessary to remove all trace and smell. The numbers of lumps actually prescribed are there for 'unseen' (adrṣṭa) reasons; hence, for example, the rather startling ruling (given by Tryambaka himself in section IV, p. 286), that a woman who is menstruating requires sixty lumps to cleanse herself on the fourth day, a widow who is menstruating twice as many. 
With regard to the practices described in both this section and the previous one, Vidyarṇava remarks with satisfaction that they are easily followed in Indian villages even today. Indeed he laments their abandonment in the cities where 'every house has got its privy.' In his view, 'the old system' provided a number of advantages which are lacking in the new: early morning exercise ('whether they liked it or not'); no need for 'costly systems of sanitation and drain- age'; and it did not compel a whole class of people (sweepers) 'to a degraded form of livelihood'. Most important of all, it kept houses clean without 'the necessity of setting apart a portion of it for the accumulation of filth' (1979:12-13). We may assume that many traditionalists today would share his opinion that modern sanitation is in fact a change for the worse.

The sipping ritual (ācamanam; Sdhp.5r.4–5v.1) First, as Devala explains, acamana must be performed as soon as sauca is completed. 'When one has washed with water each foot in turn as far as the knee, one should wash both hands as far as the wrist, and then perform acamana.'47 In fact, ācamana is a pre- liminary to all ritual acts (cf. Har. on Āp.1.5.15.1; Gobh.gṛ.1.1.2). It is to be performed before reciting the Veda (Manu V.138), both before and after meals, after sleeping, sneezing and spitting (cf. Gaut.I.1.40; Manu V.145; Gobh.gr.1.2.32), as well as after urinat- ing or defecating (cf. acamananimittāni; Sm.C.II.p.260 ff.). That a male reference is usually assumed is demonstrated by the ruling that one should perform acamana after touching a woman, or after talking to a woman or a sudra during a meal. 
A sloka from Yäjñavalkya explains how this sipping should be done (ācamanaprakāra[ḥ]). 'Sitting in a clean place, with one's hands between one's knees (antarjānu), and facing either north or east, a dvija should always sip (water) from the base of the thumb (brahmatīrtha).'48 The term antarjānu indicates a sitting posture with the knees spread (cf. Gonda 1980:62-3). The brahmatīrtha at the base of the thumb is one of several sacred spots on the hand. The others, according to Yājñ.1.19 and Viș.Sm.62.1-4, are the base of the smallest finger (präjäpatyatirtha); the base of the index finger (pitṛtīrtha); and the tips of the fingers (daivatīrtha). Once again, we have the irony of a ruling for the dvija (now reclassified as male) being applied to women (who are consistently grouped with śūdras). 
More important, Tryambaka omits the usual directives in such contexts (and in that of mūtrapurīṣotsarga; cf. Yājñ.I.1.16; Sm.C.II. p.235-6) concerning the sacred thread (yajñopavīta). The equi- valent instruction in Gautama, for example, reads: sitting in a clean place, placing one's right arm between one's knees, and wearing the sacred thread (yajñopavītī), one should wash both

hands as far as the wrist... and so on (Gaut.I.1.35; Par.M.I.i. p.235). Haradatta glosses yajñopavītī in two ways: first, as having the sacred thread in its normal place (over the left shoulder, cf. Manu II.63; Gobh.gr.1.2.2); and alternatively, as referring to the arrangement of one's upper garment (athavottarīyavinyās- ārtham). This seems to be yet another example of a reference to an initiated person being reinterpreted so that it can be applied to the uninitiated. However, Haradatta proceeds to quote Baudh.I.5.15.1, according to which one should be yajñopavītī on a number of dif- ferent occasions including during the acamana ritual, and as he does so the alternative interpretation seems increasingly inappropriate. Yet Bühler has preferred this second interpretation in his transla- tion of both passages (1975:54, 180-1). Tryambaka, however, has done his best to avoid the issue altogether. But even the quotation he has selected (Yājñ.1.18; see note 48) includes the term dvija, glossed in the Mitäkṣarā as na sūdrādiḥ, an expression that surely excludes women too. 
Nonetheless, it is obvious that neither Tryambaka nor Yājña- valkya wish to prevent women or sudras from performing the aca- mana ritual. For at the end of this subsection, Tryambaka quotes Yājñ.I.21 to declare that 'dvijas are purified by water reaching the heart, throat and palate respectively; women and sūdras by merely touching it once.'49 The second half of this sloka is the other example of rulings specific to women given in Tryambaka's introduction (section I, p. 40, note 26). The last phrase (sakṛt sprṣṭābhir antataḥ) has been variously interpreted, as has the equivalent phrase of Manu II.62 (sūdrah sprstābhir antatah). Antatah is glossed either as antena meaning 'at the extremity (of mouth or lips)', or as antar- gatena meaning 'inside (the mouth, Mit.). Kullūka specifies that water need only touch the extremity of the tongue and lips (cf. Apar.), even if it does not reach the throat; Rāghavānanda the tip of the tongue; Nandana the outside edge of the lips. Ramacandra prefers the more straightforward and strictly grammatical inter- pretation of 'finally' to indicate that (although strī is not in fact specified in the Manu quotation) women and sudras constitute

77 
the last varna category. 50 Whichever interpretation is accepted, how- ever, women are entitled to perform acamana. But, once again, both the intrinsic impurity of sūdras and the lower standards of purification required of them are ascribed to women. 
Tryambaka quotes two further slokas on the water to be used for sipping (ācamanärtham udakam). First, according to Parāśara, 'one should sip water that has been "drawn up” (i.e. from a well or river or other source of fresh water), free of foam or bubbles, neither heated by fire nor brackish (akṣāra; glossed by Nand. on Vis. Sm. 62.5 as "any bad water")'.51 Or, to use Yajnavalkya's phrase, one should use water in its natural state (prakṛtisthābhiḥ; Yajñ.1.20). The second sloka, attributed to Pracetas, adds two exceptions (višeṣam). First, 'according to the wise, (acamana has the desired) purifying effect at night even when one uses water one cannot see.' Secondly, 'hot water (is allowed) in the case of sick people who are in the habit of drinking hot water.'52 The latter point refers to the traditional view, based on ayurvedic practices, that people suffering from fever (jvara) should drink hot water and never cold. In such a state, it is believed that one should observe a strict fast; only water is allowed, and this should be boiled and served warm on the grounds that cold water heightens fever (Jolly 1901:70-4). Tryambaka does not concern himself with the mass of rules relating to when sipping should be done (ācamananimitṭāni; e.g. Sm.C. II.p. 260 ff.); when it should be done twice (dviracamana- nimittäni; e.g. Sm.C.II.p.264 ff.); nor the various exceptions and prohibitions relating to it (e.g. Sm.C.II.p.265 ff.).

Cleaning the teeth (dantadhavanam; Sdhp.5v.1–9) 
According to Sat.Br.X.5.2.11-12, the mouth is clammy in the morning because the two internal deities that live in the eyes (cf. section IIC, p.215 below) have been making love all night and shedding seed. Tryambaka merely remarks that, according to Atri, 'when the mouth is stale (i.e. after the night's sleep), men (naraḥ, superordinate) are always impure; one should therefore chew on (lit. 'eat') either a green (lit. 'moist') or a dry teeth-cleaning twig.'53 This is still the practice in villages today, and even in towns teeth-cleaning sticks are sold on busy railway stations. In terms of ähnika, it is an independent ritual act rendering the mouth (as opposed to the whole body) pure. It is therefore not simply a part (anga) of the morning bath (cf. Vīr.Ā.p.121). 
In comparison with other smrti sections on teeth-cleaning twigs, Tryambaka's is brief. In Vis.Sm.61, for example, there are detailed rules concerning the types of twig that may or may not be used, varying from those of particular trees (cf. Br.Sam.85) to those with particular qualities (sweet, sour, withered, perforated, smelly, smooth and so on). Even more surprising is Tryambaka's omission of the gender specific rules concerning the appropriate length of a teeth-cleaning twig. According to Vis.Sm.61.16, the twig should be as thick as one's little finger and twelve angulas long. The Smṛti- candrikā, however, quotes Garga to prove that the length of the twig should vary according to one's asrama and gender: ten angulas for a brahmin, nine for a kṣatriya, eight for a vaiśya, seven for a śūdra, and four for a woman (Sm.C.II.p.278). If one takes this to be the usual diminishing scale of ritual purity, then even high-caste women are now not equal to but inferior to the sudra male. Perhaps Tryambaka did not wish to go that far. 
For an alternative to the teeth-cleaning twig, Tryambak'a turns to the Smrtyarthasara. 'One may clean one's teeth with one's fingers but one should avoid using the index finger; strong teeth 
53. atha dantadhāvanam // Sdhp.5v.1. taträtriḥ // mukhe paryușite nityam bhavanty aprayatā narāḥ / tad ārdrakāṣtham suskam va bhakṣayed danta- dhāvanam // Sdhp.5v.1-2 (Atri) < Par.M.I.i.p.252 (bhavaty aprayato naraḥ for bhavanty aprayatā narāḥ; Atri); Sm.M.II.p.240 (as Par.M.; dhāvane for 'dhavanam; Atri); LaghuSat.74 (as Par.M.; tasmāt sarvaprayatnena for tad ārdrakāstham suskam vā); Śm.C.II.p.276 (Śāt.; as LaghuŚāt).

are formed by using the middle finger, the fourth (or ring-) finger, or the thumb.'54 The arbitrary nature of this ruling becomes evident when it is compared with similar pronouncements in the Smṛti- candrikā. The latter explains, for example, both that one may not use one's fingers except the thumb and fourth finger; and that one may use grass, leaves, water or one's fingers, but not the fourth finger (Sm.C.II.p.272 ff.). 
The days on which one should not clean one's teeth (varja- divasā[h]) are listed in a sloka that Tryambaka attributes to Visnu. 'One should avoid cleaning one's teeth on a day when offerings are made to the dead, on one's birthday, on the day of a marriage, when one is suffering from indigestion (ajīrṇa), when one is observ- ing a vow (vrate), and on a fast day.'55 Since these rulings concern matters of ritual rather than bodily purity, we may assume that on the days mentioned, although the stale taste of morning may persist in the mouth, it will not render one ritually impure. 
Tryambaka explains that 'since the above prohibition on teeth- cleaning on a fast day applies (as it stands; i.e. assuming the üha of gender) to women as well as to men, Manu adds a modifying rule for women.'56 It runs as follows. 'None of these are polluting to women on a fast day: flowers, ornaments, clothes, perfume, ointment, cleaning the teeth and collyrium (for the eyes).'57 The implication is that a man undergoing a fast is polluted by these things. However, according to Tryambaka's next quotation, attri- buted to Visnu, this modification is itself modified if a woman's husband is away (proṣitabhartṛkāṇam viseṣam): the prohibition

Strīdharmapaddhati 
on teeth-cleaning is reapplied (cf. section IV, p. 291). Thus, ‘if her husband is away, a woman should not eat on a day when offerings are made to the dead, or on the day of a sacrifice, or when she is observing a vow (niyame); and in this context "she should not eat" means "she should not clean her teeth."'58 The gloss derives from the fact that the twig is chewed at one end to form a brush with which the teeth are cleaned. 
This issue of teeth-cleaning, never clearly spelled out, seems to involve three quite distinct aspects, each relevant at the appropriate time and to the appropriate individual. First, as mentioned above, it is an independent ritual act to make the mouth pure after the night's sleep. If this is not done, one remains ritually impure, and thus unable to participate in the ritual aspects of the coming day. In the case of women, the matter is somewhat confused by the well-known saying that a woman's mouth is always pure (Manu V.130). However, as I explain in section III in relation to Tryam- baka's discussion of the unique purity of women, this means merely that a woman's mouth is always pure for her husband to kiss. If this were not so, he would too easily render himself impure. But this is a special case. It is not designed to excuse women from the ritual act of cleaning their teeth in the early morning. We may also note in passing that the saying arose because of the general assumption that women are a priori impure; hence the need to make an exception for the intimate relations of husband and wife. There is no equivalent assumption concerning the impurity of men and therefore no need for a parallel statement that a man's mouth is always pure for his wife to kiss. 
Secondly, cleaning the teeth is a sensual pleasure. The Vedic student, for example, is enjoined to avoid such pleasures as sleeping on a bed, cleaning his teeth, bathing for pleasure, applying collyrium to his eyes or ointments to his body, wearing shoes or carrying a parasol (Vas.VII.15). Gautama too specifies both bathing and cleaning the teeth among the pleasures to be avoided by the Vedic

student; the others include honey, meat, perfumes, garlands, sleeping in the daytime, playing musical instruments, dancing and singing (I.2.19). Haradatta glosses snānam as 'bathing for pleasure' (sukhārtham uṣnatoyādina kanthad adhaḥ prakṣālanam); danta- dhāvanam as 'removing dirt from the teeth' (dantamalāpakarṣaṇam). Both are described as bodily rather than ritual acts, performed for obvious (drsta) not otherworldly (adrṣta) reasons. Āp.I.2.7.11 declares simply that the Vedic student should be dusty (rajasvalo malinagātraḥ, Ujj.); and that he should have dirty teeth (raktadan, 'having red or discoloured teeth', a Vedic form, glossed by Ujj. as pakvadanta [h], 'decaying teeth'). Even after the student has completed his Vedic studies, he may not indulge in such sensual pleasures in his teacher's presence. Thus if his teacher visits him or if he visits his teacher, he may not wear garlands, oil his hair, wear a turban or shoes and so on, or clean his teeth until he is once more out of his teacher's sight (Āp.1.2.8.1-5). Clearly, this is the context in which to understand the prohibitions on teeth-cleaning given by Tryambaka. On a śrāddha day, on a day when one is observ- ing a vow or fast (in the case of men), one should not indulge in the sensual pleasure of cleaning the teeth. 
But this does not explain why the rule for fasting should supersede the usual ähnika rule for teeth-cleaning only with respect to men. The ruling makes sense, however, if we allow a third aspect to the issue of teeth-cleaning: that of making oneself attractive; an aspect that seems to be applied more regularly to women than to men. Since women are expected to make themselves attractive as long as their husbands are around, the rule for fasting is waived in their case. But as soon as their husbands go away, the wife need (indeed, should) no longer make herself attractive: the rule for fasting is reimposed and therefore she should not clean her teeth (see section IV, p. 291). We may also note that cleaning the teeth is one of the many activities to be avoided by the menstruating woman until after her ritual bath on the fourth day (see section IV, pp. 286-7). Since a man is not supposed to have sexual intercourse with his wife at this time, it makes sense that she should not make herself attractive to him; indeed, as Tryambaka explains in his section on general behaviour, the menstruating woman should keep her mouth hidden from her husband in order to discourage him from polluting himself (Sdhp.23v.3-4 Sk.P.III.2.7.26b-27a; section IV, pp. 273-4). 
82 
Stridharmapaddhati 
However, there are two further contradictions here. First, in his list of things to be avoided (varjanīyāḥ), Tryambaka rules that austerities (tapas) are not to be observed by women (section IV, p. 275, note 7); yet fasting is clearly a form of tapas. Secondly, according to Tryambaka (and Manu), marriage is for women the equivalent of upanayana for men, and serving her husband the equivalent of serving one's teacher (section I, p.35, notes 15, 16), Yet the behaviour required of the Vedic student is specifically not applied to the married woman except when her husband is away or dead. In fact, only the woman whose husband is away, and the widow, are actually expected to adopt the behaviour and lifestyle of the Vedic student (section IV, pp. 291, 299-300). While the analogy remains an uplifting one, therefore, in practice the wife's service to her husband is equivalent to the student's service to his teacher only when the husband-teacher is no longer there. 
Finally, the rule that one who suffers from indigestion (ajīrņa; see note 55) should also not clean his teeth suggests that there is a fourth or ayurvedic aspect to the matter. Other remedies include sleeping in the daytime, and pills or stomach rubs made of pepper, asafoetida and so on (Jolly 1901:77). 
The ritual bath (snanam; Sdhp.6v.5-7r.3) 
After a brief section on looking after cows (gosevanam; see above, pp. 65-9), Tryambaka proceeds to enumerate the various rulings concerning the pre-dawn ritual bath.59 Before dealing with these, it is necessary to comment briefly on ritual bathing in general. 
First, the bath required for cleansing purposes is called 'dirt- removing' (malakarṣaṇa) and is another issue altogether (Sm.C.II. p.290). This is the bath performed 'for pleasure' that is forbidden to the Vedic student (Har. on Gaut.I.2.19; Āp.I.2.7.11; Vas. VII.15). Secondly, the ritual bath is of three kinds: nitya (obligatory, i.e. every day); naimittika (on particular occasions); and kāmya (if one desires particular rewards; cf. Dakṣa II.48; Sm.C.II.p.291). Tryambaka is concerned primarily with nityasnāna, the daily bath obligatory to all varnas (cf. Baudh.II.4.3b; Sm.A.p.26; Sm.C.II. pp. 291 ff.; only briefly with naimittikasnāna; and not at all with kāmyasnāna. 
The number of obligatory (nitya) baths prescribed for a man varies according to his aśrama: one for the Vedic student, two for

householders, two or three for forest hermits, and three for the renunciate (cf. Yajñ.1.95,100, III.48; Manu VI.6, 22; Sm.C.II. p.483; Sm.A.p.26, etc.). If one bathes only once, it must be shortly before dawn; if twice, before dawn and at midday; if three times, before dawn, at midday and shortly before sunset. When we look at the ähnika duties set out by Tryambaka for women, however, we see that the midday bath normally prescribed for their husbands is omitted. Since Tryambaka does not draw attention to it, it is not clear whether the omission is significant or not. However, we may also note that, since there is no distinction according to varna, women cannot here be grouped together with sudras. By default, therefore, they are now classed with the least advanced āśrama for men, that of the (temporary, not perpetual) Vedic student. This recalls, perhaps unintentionally, the claim that marriage for a woman is equivalent to Vedic studentship for a man (Manu II.67; see section I, notes 15,16). If the omission is significant, then this is one of the few aspects of the lifestyle of the Vedic student that the married woman adopts. 
Tryambaka's first point, attributed to Visnu, is that 'for brahmins, kṣatriyas and vaisyas, the (ritual) bath must be performed with mantras; for sūdras and women-O son of the Kurus-it is silent (i.e. without mantras).60 According to Baudhayana, 'bath- ing in the sense of total immersion (in water) is enjoined as fulfilling all desires; while sprinkling (the body) with water while reciting mantras is restricted to the twice-born.'61 This is the logical con- sequence of the exclusion of women from Vedic studentship. Despite the compensatory 'initiation' of marriage, women are classed in ritual terms with the uninitiated. Hence their ritual bath is 'silent': the recitation of mantras is forbidden. 
Tryambaka's second point is that ‘a woman should not bathe naked.'62 According to Vyasa, 'a woman should never be alone, nor 
60. tatra viṣṇuḥ// brahmakṣatravisām caiva mantravat snānam iṣyate/ tūṣṇīm eva hi šūdrasya strīnām ca kurunundana ¡¡ iti ¡¡ Sdhp.6v.5-6 (Visnu) < Sm.C.II.p.484 (under mädhyamdinasnānam; Visnu); Par.I.i.p.271 (Visņu). Cf. Sm.A.p.26.

should she ever bathe naked.'63 This quotation is also included in a longer passage attributed to the Skandapurāṇa in the section on general behaviour (Sdhp.23v.7, section IV, pp. 273-4). The first point recalls Manu's remark that a woman should never be independent but always supervised by a man whether father, husband or son (Manu IX.3, V.147-8; Gaut.II.9.1; cf. section IV, p. 276, note 9). It also recalls the warnings that even a learned man should not spend time with a woman alone (e.g. Manu II.213-15). The implication is that a woman alone will either get up to mischief or come to harm. This kind of ruling derives from the view that women are inherently unfaithful, promiscuous and weak-willed, a view that Tryambaka himself discusses (and supports, with qualifications) in his comments on the inherent nature of women (strīsvabhāva; see section III). The second point, that one should not bathe naked, is also applied to men; in this context, 'naked' (nagnah) is taken to mean a man wearing only one garment (i.e. a loin-cloth) instead of two (e.g. Kull. on Manu IV.45; Nand. on Vis.Sm.64.5; Gaut.1.9.60-1, etc.). 
The Smṛtyarthasara provides Tryambaka with a further rule specific to women. 'Whenever a man is required to bathe "with his clothes on" (sacelam; i.e. as opposed to with just his lower garment), a woman whose husband is living (suvāsinī) should not bathe her head; similarly, if one has a headache or matted hair (one should also not bathe the head).'64 Curiously, according to ayurveda, while one of the causes of a headache is drinking too much water, one of the treatments is immersing the head in cold (though never hot) water, the opposite of what is stated here (Jolly 1901:118). 
Suvāsinī means literally ‘a woman with fine clothes'. But a word or phrase may have three meanings or functions (vrtti). According to the primary or literal function (abhidhã or, for the mīmāmsaka, śakti; Nyāyakośa p.854), the statement 'the cowherd's house is on the Ganges' (gangāyām ghoṣaḥ) means that it is magically perched upon the water. According to the secondary or indirect

function (lakṣaṇā), it is on the bank of the river (gangātīre ghoṣaḥ; Mīmāmsākosa VI.pp. 3340 ff.). According to the third or suggested function (vyañjanā), it is in a cool and sacred place. Lakṣaṇā may also be of two types: that in which the context gives the meaning, as in the example of the cowherd's house; and nirūḍhalakṣaṇā, in which the indirect meaning is now the established one regardless of the context. Suvāsinī is in this last category. A widow is not permitted to wear fine clothes (section IV, pp. 299–300); a well- dressed woman therefore cannot be a widow. So engrained are these ideas that the term no longer refers to a woman's clothes at all but solely and directly to her marital state. Similarly, the literal meanings of subhagā and durbhagă ('fortunate woman' and 'un- fortunate woman'; see section IIA, pp. 55-6), have given place completely to the established meanings (nirūḍhalakṣaṇā) of ‘woman whose husband is living' and 'widow'. For a woman's good fortune is judged and marked by the survival of her husband. The masculine equivalents of these terms, on the other hand, have no such establish- ed meanings; they refer in fact to a man's clothes and his fortune. 
As for the reference to washing the head, the widow may well have had her head shaved (an issue that Tryambaka considers in section IV, pp. 303-4). The suvāsinī, by contrast, would have a full head of hair, the washing of which would presumably be too time-consum- ing on a purely ritual occasion. The special occasions on which a man is obliged to bathe 'with his clothes on' (i.e. naimittikasnanam) are without exception due to inauspicious and therefore polluting causes: if he has touched an outcaste, a candāla, a woman who is menstruating or has recently given birth, a corpse and so on (cf. Gaut.II.5.28-30; Manu V.85, 103; Mit. on Yajñ.III.30; Sm.C.I. p.118). Vas.IV.38 specifies that he should submerge both his body and his head. Hence the modifying rule for the married woman, whose hair is invariably long; for the ascetic with long matted hair; and for one suffering from a headache. 
Tryambaka's last point in this sub-section explains that 'this bathing should be done in rivers and so on.'65 In a quotation attri- buted to the Harivamsa, Uma explains to Arundhati. "The flowing water of a river is recommended (for bathing), O daughter of Soma; and bathing in a clean tank or pond that is both large and full of fish (or lotuses) is also recommended; but always in daylight. But if this is not possible, if a woman is confined (to the 
65. etac ca snānam nadyādiṣu kartavyam // Sdhp.6v.10. 
 
86 
Stridharmapaddhati 
house; for example, when she is pregnant), then she should bathe from an earthenware pot; and she may use the water of nine pots. This is the ancient law.'66 In his comments on pregnancy, Tryam- baka adds that a pregnant woman should take her bath with warm water (kosnena vārinā; Sdhp.40 r. 10-40 v.1, section IV, 
pp. 288-91). The directive that one should as far as possible bathe in fresh water is frequently given: that is, in rivers, ponds, lakes, water- holes, springs, waterfalls and temple tanks 'dug by the gods' (cf. Manu IV.203; Vis.Sm.64.16-17). What is not recommended is bathing in water belonging to someone else, such as a well or a reservoir built by him, for in doing so one partakes of that man's sin (cf. Manu IV.201–2; Viș.Sm.64.1; Yājñ.I.159). If one is unable to bathe in the right places, then, as Tryambaka explains, one may bathe in one's own courtyard or house using water from pots. According to Vis. Sm.64.17, however, the most effective water for ritual purposes is that of the Ganges (cf. also Ag.P.155.6); the least effective is that brought in pots. 
About the details of the actual bath-the kind of earth to be used for washing, which clothes one may wear, at what point and in what manner one may enter the water, and so on - Tryambaka says nothing. Nor does he give any rulings concerning tarpana, the offering of water to the gods, ṛṣis and ancestors, normally performed as a part (anga) of the ritual bath. All the many mantras prescribed for twice-born men are, of course, omitted. Tryambaka also fails to mention kāmyasnāna, the ritual bath performed in order to obtain specific rewards. But since this is most often per- formed when on a pilgrimage to a sacred tīrtha, and since Tryambaka discourages both men and women from going on such pilgrimages (see section IIB, pp. 134-7), this omission is not inconsistent. The prohibitions on bathing for the menstruating woman, and the obligation to bathe on the fourth day of her menstrual cycle, are dealt with in section IV, pp. 284–7. 
With regard to the nakedness of women, but outside the specific context of bathing, we may note in passing that the term nagnikā has an interesting history. Several of the gṛhyasutras recommend a nagnikā bride. The term is defined by Vaikh.6.12 as one between the ages of eight and ten (astavarṣādā daśaman nagnikā). At the

87 
time of the earlier grhyasūtras, however, the custom of marrying an adolescent girl was only just beginning to give way to that of child marriage. Thus Gobh.gr.III.4.3-6 makes a general statement about the gotra of the (presumably adolescent) bride, then adds as an afterthought that a nagnikā is best (nagnikā tu śreṣṭhā; v.6). Măn.gr.I.7.8 recommends successively a girl who has not yet experienced sexual intercourse (kanyam aspṛṣṭamaithunām), who is younger than the groom (yavīyasīm), and a nagnikā. Astāvakra's commentary defines the latter term as 'one who has not yet develop- ed female sexual characteristics' (aprāptastrībhāvām ayauvan- arasām). The reference to sexual inexperience suggests that an adolescent bride was the accepted custom, and thus that the require- ment of a nagnikā or pre-adolescent girl is an afterthought. If the latter were the rule, the former epithet would-one hopes-be unnecessary. Mātṛdatta's commentary on what is almost certainly an incorrect reading of Hir.gr.1.19.2 clearly demonstrates this overlap in marriage customs. Faced with the apparent ruling that a man should marry a bride who is both a nagnikā and a brahma- cāriņī (i.e. leading a celibate life), Mātṛdatta seeks to evade the con- tradiction by defining the former as 'one who has begun to menstru- ate (nagnikām āsannārtavām) and who is therefore fit to throw aside her clothes (tasmad vastravik ṣepaṇārhā nagnikā), that is, fit for sexual intercourse (maithunärhety arthah).' This obviously con- tradicts the accepted definition of the term. 
In fact, Hir.gr.1.19.2 should read anagnikā (Bhandarkar 1893: 151 ff.; Thieme 1971:174). Thieme discusses the implications of both terms. He divides the life of a woman into four stages: bālya ('childhood'; i.e. until menstruation); kaumāra ('unmarried girl- hood'; i.e. the three years or, according to some, three months following puberty, during which period a husband should be found); yauvana ('youth'; i.e. a woman's child-bearing years); and sthavira ('old age'; i.e. beyond child-bearing). Hence a woman should be protected by her father in her girlhood (kaumāre), by her husband in her married life (yauvane), and by her son in her old age (sthavire; Vas. V.3; Manu IX.3 etc.). If she reaches the third stage and is still unmarried, she is no longer under her father's supervision: she may find her own husband (Manu IX.90; Vas.17.67-8; alternatively, Vis.Sm.24.40; see also the story of Savitrī in section V). Nagnikā and anagnikā belong to the first two stages. As the Gṛhasangraha (Gobhilaputra's appendix to the Gobhilagṛhyasūtra) explains, a girl is called nagnikā as long as she has not started menstruating (yāvan na ṛtumatī bhavet; ‘zu ergänzen: aber kurz davorsteht', 
 
88 
Strīdharmapaddhati 
Thieme); she is called anagnikā when she has begun menstruating (ṛtumatī; ‘zu ergänzen: aber erst seit kurzem', Thieme); one should therefore give one's daughter in marriage when she is anagnikā ('zu ergänzen: aber nicht schon eine präptayauvana', Thieme 1971:175; Gṛhasangraha II.17). But as the age of marriage dropped from the teens to pre-teens-and even to the age of four (Br.P. 165.7) or five (Par.M.I.ii.p.77, Marīci)—the ideal of an anagnikā bride was replaced by that of a nagnikā. 
The pattern of later texts is the same. The ideal bride is not physically mature and sexually inexperienced but physically im- mature; a child still young enough to run around 'naked'. Accord- ing to Vas.XVII.70, for example, a father should give his daughter in marriage while she is still a nagnikā; if she remains at home after the onset of menstruation, he will incur the sin of a possible conception lost (cf. ṛtukāladharmäḥ, section IV, pp. 287-8). Accord- ing to Gaut.II.9.21–3, a girl should be given in marriage before she reaches puberty (prāg rtoh); according to some, before she wears any clothes (prāg väsasah pratipatter). According to Sm.C.I.p.213, a girl is called nagnikā as long as she does not cover her body out of embarrassment (yavan na lajjayāngāni... avaguhet) when in the presence of men (puruṣasannidhau). Angāni (‘limbs') is glossed as yonyādiny ('private parts, etc.'). Alternatively, she is nagnikā as long as she need not wear an (upper) garment (yavac celam na gṛhṇāti), or as long as she does not menstruate (yavat ṛtudarśanam). When nakedness carries such associations, it is hardly surprising that a married woman, even when bathing, is not permitted to be naked. 
Getting dressed (vastradhāraṇam; Sdhp.7r.3–9) 
Tryambaka begins by quoting from the Matsyapurāṇa. ‘After bath- ing in this way, one should perform the ritual of sipping according to the rule, and then, rising up (from the sitting position), one should put on clean white clothes (vāsasī śukle suddhe).'67 Vāsasī, in the dual form, indicates both upper and lower garments. This, together with the requirement to wear white (śukle), clearly applies not to women but to men. For women, white is the colour of death,

worn by widows (Wood 1980:260; Rai and Singh 1983:84–5; Fuller and Logan 1985:89-92 etc.) and Jaina nuns (many of whom are also widows; Jaini 1979:246, note 8, 262-4, illus.27,28,30; but cf. Reynell 1985:26.4.2.iv). In his comments on widowhood, Tryambaka rules that the widow should not wear dyed garments (vikṛtam; glossed by Tryambaka as mañjiṣṭādir añjitam, ‘dyed with Indian madder, etc.'; Sdhp.46r.8) and then describes how the widowed daughters-in-law of Dhṛtarastra wear 'white garments' (suklottarīya, Sdhp.47[2]r.10 Mbh.XV.32.15; see section IV, pp. 299-300). The Mitākṣarā, however, glosses 'white' (śukle) as 'washed' (dhaute; Mit.on Yājñ.I.131). 
With regard to men, although the householder is usually enjoined to wear white garments (e.g. Manu IV.35; Yājñ.I.131), the Smṛti- candrikā quotes Bhṛgu (acc. to the Mysore edn.; Garga acc. to Gharpure) to the effect that while a brahmin should wear white, a kṣatriya should wear red or bright garments, a vaiśya yellow ones, and a sudra dark blue or dirty ones (nīlam malavat; Sm.C.II.p.298). Cloth died blue with indigo is invariably forbidden (e.g. Āp.Sm.VI. 4 ff.; Mit. on Yājñ.III.292; cf. Sdhp.20 v.10-21r.2). According to Uśanas, black is prohibited; according to Gautama, all dyed cloth is prohibited (Sm.C.II.p.298). But there are no recommenda- tions concerning the colours that a woman should or should not 
wear. 
Another significant difference between the rulings on dress for women and those for men is that only the latter refer to the sacred thread. For example, Ap.II.2.4.22-3 explains that the householder should always wear an upper garment (as well as a lower one); but if he is poor, he need only wear the sacred thread on his upper body. According to Vas.XII.14, the snataka must wear both upper and lower garments and two sacred threads. The rulings for women as explained by Tryambaka make no mention of the sacred thread for the obvious reason that women are now excluded from the upanayana, and the 'initiation' of marriage does not really count. 
Nor may we find any similarities between the rulings on dress for women and those recommended for the Vedic student (with whom married women are so often compared). For the emphasis in this context is on the material of which the garments are made. The lower garment of the brahmin student should be made of hemp, that of the ksatriya of flax, and that of the vaisya of wool, each dyed the appropriate colour. The upper garment should ideally consist of the skin of an animal: the black antelope, the spotted deer, and

Stridharmapaddhati 
the goat or cow respectively (e.g. Manu II.41; Vas.XI.64–7; Āp.I. 2.39-1.3.10). What the staff, girdle and thread should be made of in the case of each twice-born varna is also discussed (e.g. Manu II.42 ff.). Evidently, none of this is of any relevance to the women of Tryambaka's day. 
Since Tryambaka's aim is to give general rules that are, in prin- ciple, applicable to both men and women, we must expect to gloss over the anomalies. His second quotation, from Uśanas, seems more straightforward. 'After taking one's bath, one should put on uncontaminated clothes (anupahatam vastram), according to the rule, '68 
The term anupahata (lit. 'undamaged') or, more commonly, ahata (lit. 'unbeaten') is interesting for, depending on the context, it may have a variety of related meanings. First, since clothes are 'beaten' in the Indian washing process, often with a stick, ahata may denote 'unbeaten' or ‘unwashed' and therefore dirty clothes. Thus Devala remarks that, when performing rituals, a man should wear cloth he has washed himself (svayam dhautena), not that washed by a washerman (nejakadhautena), and certainly never cloth that is 'unwashed' (ahatena; Sm.C.II.p.299). The second meaning is both more usual and more appropriate to Tryambaka's ruling. According to this interpretation, ahata may mean 'unwashed' in the sense of being unused and therefore perfect. The Smṛti- candrikā gives two definitions along these lines. In the āhnika section, ahata is said to denote brand-new cloth (yantranirmuktam, straight from the loom; Sm.C.II.p.299, Satyatapas). Such cloth should be worn on ritual occasions by the sacrificer and his wife (e.g. Śab. on Jai.X.4.13); it is also appropriate for auspicious rituals such as marriage (Sm.C.II.p.299). Alternatively-in a quotation attributed to Pulastya in the ähnika section (Sm.C.II. p. 298) and to Pracetas in the upanayana section (Sm.C.I.p.76) – the term denotes cloth that, although washed a little (īṣaddhautam), is still new and white, with its fringes still intact (sadaśam), unworn, and therefore ritually pure (sarvakarmāsu pāvanam). In the upanayana section, however, the term is applied exclusively to the dress of the (male) brahmin initiate (suklam ahatam vāso brāhmaṇasya; Sm.C.I.p.75). When applied by Tryambaka to the daily dress of all orthodox women, it must presumably be under-

stood more loosely to denote garments that are in perfect condition, perfectly clean, and therefore ritually pure. 
A third possibility is that ahata denotes 'undamaged' cloth in the sense that it has never been 'cut' or 'stitched'; that is, the full woven length of the dhoti or sari as opposed to the cut cloth of the bodice or shirt. On these grounds, even today, men are required to remove their shirts before entering the inner sanctum of a temple. Similarly, in some south Indian temples even fifty or sixty years ago, women were required to enter without a blouse (Sanjukta Gupta: personal communication; cf. also Thapliyal 1979:59). This issue gains an added significance in the context of rulings related to whether or not a woman should wear a bodice (see below). 
Tryambaka then gives the most important modifying rules (vastradhāraṇe viseṣam) relating to women. He quotes Sarikha. '(A woman) should not show her navel; she should wear garments that extend to her ankles; and she should not expose her breasts.' 69 In section IV, this quotation, again attributed to Sankha, is repeated together with the ruling that she should not go outside without an upper garment (nānuktā gṛhan nirgacchen nanuttarīya...; Sdhp. 22r.9-22v. 1; see p.273). In his comments on widowhood, however, Tryambaka insists that the widow should not wear a bodice (Sdhp. 46r.7-8, section IV, p.299). In this context, therefore, the bodice is one of the marks of the woman whose husband is alive. 
A parallel to these rules on how a woman should wear her sari may be found in the rules concerning how a man should wear his dhoti. The latter should be tucked in at three points: near the navel, on the left side, and at the back. A brahmin who does this incorrectly is held to be a sūdra (Sm.M.II.p.351-3; Sm.C.II.p.300). However, both the purpose and the emphasis of the two sets of rules are quite different. A man is required to fold and tuck his garment in the 'right' way, presumably for otherworldly or 'unseen' (adrṣṭa) reasons; no mention is made of which parts of his body the garment is intended to conceal. But the rules for women give no guidance on how one should fold, wind and tuck the sari. This is especially surprising in view of the fact that there are a number of ways of

wearing the sari and that in Maharashtra (and thus presumably in this Maratha kingdom) the sakaccha style was held to be a mark of the upper classes, the vikaccha of the lower ones (cf. Altekar 1978:289-91; plates IV,V,VII). The rules concerning a woman's dress merely enjoin which parts of her anatomy she may not reveal: her breasts, her navel and her legs down to the ankle. This is obvious- ly another kind of ruling altogether. 
The first point to stress is that the prohibition on showing the ankles can only apply to the wealthier class of woman who is not required to work outdoors. Any visitor to India today will notice that women working in the fields or in the coastal fishing villages wear their saris hoisted well above their ankles so as not to impede their work. In this context, Tryambaka's ruling is a mark of social distinction as well as decorum. 
Is this also true of the ruling that a woman should not expose her breasts? Dharmasastra and nibandha literature are in agreement on this point: the breasts should be covered, either by a bodice or by the sari, or by an additional 'upper garment'. In the Gandhāra sculptures, certainly, the women appear fully covered. But how may we account for the many examples of bare-breasted women in the sculptures and paintings of southern and central India? 
Is it a matter of caste or class? If (as seems to be the case in the prohibition on showing the ankles) dharmaśāstra rulings apply only to the higher or wealthier varnas, then one would expect the semi-nude female figures to be of the lower orders such as maid- servants and dancing girls. But this is not so. In the paintings of Ajanta and the sculptures of Bharhut, for example, it is the court ladies and not the maid-servants who are without upper garments, even in public scenes. 
It is important to disentangle several related questions here. First, what is the role of the artist (silpin) in Indian society? Second- ly, what is the relationship between the artist and the specialist in religious law (dharmaśāstrin)? Finally, what may we deduce about the dress of court women in eighteenth-century Thanjavur? In a study of this nature, my answers will of necessity be brief.70 With regard to the first question, two artistic conventions seem to be operating at once. According to the realistic convention, the

artist portrays social dress and customs as he sees them around him. According to the supernatural convention, he presents my- thological figures as conceived by the tradition he espouses. The line between these two conventions is not always clearly drawn. Cōla bronzes, for example, tend to portray the dress of royalty of that period combined with traditional iconographic features (cf. Nagaswamy 1983:46-51, 165-70). Thus the ornaments, head- dress and lower garments worn by Parvati seem to reflect the former; the sacred thread presumably belongs to the latter (cf. Nagaswamy 1983:54, 144-5, 168; The Image of Man 1982:67; Ions 1967:92; Rowland 1970:328-9; etc.). 
But to which convention does her naked upper body belong? We do not deduce from Manet's 'Le Déjeuner sur l'Herbe' either that it was the custom for high-class women to picnic naked amidst fully clothed men or that the lady in question is a courtesan. Do we need to assume from the paintings of Ajanta or the sculptures of Bharhut that women were in the habit of going around half- dressed? It is true that nudes in European art are usually restricted either to mythological characters (e.g. Venus, 'The Three Graces', 'The Judgement of Paris') or to private scenes of bathroom or bedroom (Clouet's 'Lady in the Bath', Manet's 'Olympia', Ingres' 'The Bather of Valpinçon' and 'Odalisque with Slave'). Indeed, Manet's 'Le Déjeuner sur l'Herbe' caused an uproar when it was first shown, precisely because it depicted what was apparently a common public scene. It is perhaps surprising that there is no parallel condemnation of inappropriate semi-nudity in Sanskrit literature. But it has long been the custom in all Indian temple sculpture-Hindu, Buddhist and Jain-to use the half-naked and (according to Western standards of beauty) voluptuous female body as a decorative motif. In the realm of art, the female form is both exposed and extolled. 
It is clear that the second question regarding the relationship between dharmaśästra and art is crucial here. Where there were no specific dharmasastric guidelines, the artist presumably reproduced what he saw around him. If such guidelines existed, however, it seems unlikely that he would deliberately go against them. On these grounds, therefore, we may suppose that the many representa- tions of women with naked breasts did not contravene the dharma- śăstra rulings current at the time. 
Judging by Tryambaka's statements, however, by the eighteenth 
 
94 
Strīdharmapaddhati 
century, they did. How may we explain this? The question may be approached in two ways: with reference to the different social customs prevalent in north and south India; and in relation to foreign, especially Muslim, influence. 
The Ajanta paintings show royal women with naked breasts while female servants wear blouses or dresses. If it was customary for high-class women in the cooler north to wear upper garments and those in the hot south not to, then was Tryambaka simply ruling that the women of the Thanjavur court should adopt the northern rather than the southern habit? Certainly, if women were expected to enter south Indian temples without a blouse (see ahata above), this was evidently considered proper female attire. But the issue is by no means clear. Hāla's Saptaśataka, for example, describes southern women wearing bodices (kancukī; IV.95, VII.20) or upper garments (dukūla; IV.69). The significance of the south Indian heat becomes evident in the Sahendraviläsa where the women of Šāhaji's court are described as being torn between wearing bodices for modesty's sake and removing them to keep cool (VII.78–9, 83). Perhaps the question of foreign influence is more relevant. The bodice (kañcuka, kūrpāsa(ka), colī) is listed among the 'foreign elements' in Thapliyal's book on the subject and she notes that upper class women were especially influenced by foreign fashions (1979:64-6). In particular, the importance of Muslim influence must be explored. For it is indisputable that as Muslim power and culture descended from the north of India, Islamic ideals of female modesty spread, especially among the ruling classes. Not sur- prisingly, the sculptures of Bharhut (Śunga period, 185-72 B.C.), Sanchi (Śunga, early Andhra, later Andhra, 185 B.C.-A.D. 320), Amaravati (especially later Andhra, 25 B.C.-A.D. 320) and Ellora (fifth to eighth centuries A.D.), and the paintings of Ajanta (first century B.C.-seventh century A.D.; Rowland 1970), long precede the invasion of Islam into the Deccan (A.D.1296) and its further descent into southern India (1310; see Leslie 1983(2): appendix B). 
It is more difficult to pinpoint the relative chronology of the Šankha ruling. Kane assigns the core of the Sankhadharmasūtra to the period 300 B.c.-A.d. 100 (PVK I.i.p.142), but this is not to say that the quotation given here is part of that early compilation. The question of chronology is especially difficult in relation to a text (or texts) known only from quotations. If we look at the works in which this particular ruling is cited, however, we may note that

95 
all three predate the Muslim invasions of the south by at least a hundred years: the Mitākṣarā, 1100-1120 (PVK I.ii.871; 1120-5, Derrett 1973(1):50); Aparārka's commentary, 1125, Northern Konkaṇa (PVK I.ii. 2 80; 1115-30, Derrett 1973(1):50); and the Smṛticandrikā, the great authority in the south, 1150-1225 (PVK I.ii.286). 
But, whatever the relationship between female attire in the largely autonomous court of Thanjavur in the early eighteenth century and Islamic ideals, we may be sure that Tryambaka was a product of his time. Another product of the period is a collection of illustrations entitled Drawings of the Costumes of the Southern Peninsula of India by a Native of Tanjore, compiled in 1815 and depicting a man and a woman in each of several categories (David 1815). This shows that women of high status wore bodices (e.g. 'Rajapoot... Rajawar... Kharkana brahmin... Mogul.. priestess' etc.). A mid-way category shows women without bodices but covering their breasts with the loose end of the sari often worn in the sakaccha style (e.g. ‘oilmonger... brahmin?... Sathare . . . a kind of brahmin... Vishnu brahmin' etc.). Finally, women of low status leave the breasts uncovered altogether ('shoemaker. well-digger... conjurer... marava... washerman... weaver' etc.). Tryambaka is surely making a similar point. 
He also rules that ‘(a woman) should not dress herself and so on while her husband is watching.'71 The following two slokas are attributed to Vyasa. 'If her beloved (husband) is watching, she should neither anoint (her head) with oil, bathe, massage unguents (e.g. sandalwood paste; see plate 2) into her body, clean her teeth, arrange her hair, eat, vomit, sleep, dress, nor beautify herself in any way (prārambham maṇḍanānām). '72 The phrase prārambham maṇ- danānām covers clothes, ornaments, oils and so on. The last sloka is quoted again when Tryambaka deals with the proper behaviour of the wife when she is eating (see section IIC, p. 226, note 116). There is no parallel ruling that a man should not dress himself in the presence

of his wife; nor even a general rule that might be applied to both husband and wife. 
Wearing the tilaka mark (tilakadhāraṇam; Sdhp.7r.9–7 v.9) 
Tryambaka's next concern is to show that putting the auspicious tilaka mark on the forehead is a necessary part of the wife's toilette (plate 5). In doing so, he lists all the other things that indicate that a woman's husband is still alive; a description, in fact, of the suvāsinī (see pp. 84-5). The two ślokas, attributed here to Mārkaṇḍeya, are also to be found in Tryambaka's encyclopaedic commentary on the Rāmāyaṇa, the Dharmākūta; they are attributed there to Vyasa and are part of a lengthy comment on the tilaka metaphor given below. The same two ślokas are attributed to Aśvalayana in the section on general behaviour (Sdhp.22v.5-7; see section IV, pp. 273-4); and to the Skandapurāṇa as quoted in the Madanaratna in Sdhp.41r.5-7 (in an altered form to apply to the pregnant woman; see section IV, pp. 288–91). They read as follows. 
'The devoted wife (pativrata) who wishes her husband to live long should not neglect (duṣaye[1]; lit. "cause to be polluted") these things: haridra (i.e. haldi, yellow turmeric powder; put between the eyebrows and used as an unguent); collyrium (or lamp- black, for the eyes; plate 3); kunkuma (saffron or a reddish paste; to make the tilaka mark on the forehead; also used as an unguent); sindūra (saffron or a red powder; to mark the parting of the hair); the short-sleeved bodice; betel (to make the lips red and the breath fresh; a late idea, cf. PVK II.ii.p.734; cf. also Kām.I.4.16); the auspicious ornament (of marriage, mangalyabharaṇam; i.e. the mangalasūtra); and the adorning of ears, hands and carefully styled hair (i.e. with ornaments, flowers and so on; plate 4).'73

Haridra is the yellow substance with which deities are smeared, especially Gaṇeśa as Haridraganapati. It is believed to be a mark of good fortune, one that could ward off demons (Stutley 1977:110). It is also one of the signs that a woman is (once more) available to her husband for, as Tryambaka himself explains (section IV, pp. 286-7), she should anoint her body with unguents of haridrā and kunkuma after she has taken her ritual bath on the fourth day of menstruation. Collyrium, obtained by inverting a small earthen- ware dish over a sooty flame, is applied to the inner eyelid to outline the eyes and exaggerate their length. Since it makes a woman at- tractive, it is prohibited to the menstruating woman (section IV, pp.284-5), the woman whose husband is away (p.291), and the widow (pp.299-300). According to Meulenbeld (1974:438), two different substances are used: one for medicinal, the other for cosmetic purposes. Saffron was used originally for both kunkuma and sindūra, that is, for both the tilaka mark on the forehead and the red line in the hair parting; but nowadays a less expensive red powder or paste is used. The tilaka is usually a round dot, al- though this may vary according to family or caste tradition: the women of Vai in Maharashtra, for example, wear the tilaka as a horizontal red line. The sindūra is more commonly associated with north Indian women and is rarely found in Tamil Nadu today (cf. Fuller and Logan 1985:90). Both tilaka and sindūra indicate that a woman is married and her husband lives. For example, a Khajuraho inscription dated A.D. 953 describes how enemies were killed and their wives thereby deprived of the use of sindura (cf. Altekar 1978:301). 
As mentioned above (p.90), the short-sleeved bodice, worn under the sari by married women, is traditionally not worn by the widow (see section IV, p. 299). Betel, ornaments and flowers make a woman attractive: like collyrium, they should be avoided by the menstruating woman, the woman whose husband is away, and the widow (see section IV, pp. 284-5, 291, 299-300). Com- plicated hair-styles (e.g. Altekar 1978: plates VIII-XI; Nagaswamy 1983:46-51,158,165-70) are also prohibited to the widow either because her head is shaved, or her hair close-cropped, or alternative- ly because she must wear it in a simple bun (see section IV, pp. 299– 300, 303-4). The menstruating woman, on the other hand, should not comb her hair (see p. 284).

Strīdharmapaddhati 
The mangalasūtra, the auspicious thread on which beads (usually black or gold) are strung, is fastened around the neck of the bride by the groom during the marriage ceremony (cf. PVK II.i.537). Chapter XV of the Laghvāśvalayanasmṛti describes the sacrament of marriage in detail and provides the earliest reference to the marriage thread (mangalyatantu, v.33; Dh.kośa III.iii.p.2048). Mantras are recited to ensure the wife's fidelity to her husband and Gauri bestows saubhagya on the bride. Saubhagya originally and literally meant 'good fortune' or 'prosperity', but it came to have as its established meaning (virūḍhalakṣaṇā) the good fortune of the happily married woman whose husband is alive. The prefix sau, with which the married woman is addressed, stands for saubha- gyavati, meaning 'fortunate woman' (i.e. by virtue of her marriage; Baudh.gr.1.6.30). The mangalasūtra, the tilaka, and the red line of sindura in the hair, are all indispensable signs of the married woman whose husband is alive; as long as he lives, they must be 
worn. 
Both the famous tilaka metaphor from the Rāmāyaṇa and Tryambaka's comment on it are taken from his own work. As he himself explains, 'that is why (wearing the tilaka is specified) in the Dharmākūta (commentary) written by me on the Rāmā- yana.'74 He begins by quoting Răm. III.8. 'When the sun resolutely remains in the direction frequented by Death (Yama; thus the south), then the northern direction like a woman without her tilaka does not shine.'75 The Dharmākūta explains. "The lady, in the form of the northern direction, whose husband-husband of the directions, jewel of the day (the sun)-has gone to the south (has died) is described as not wearing the tilaka. Therefore the lack of tilaka and so on is the defining mark of the widow (vidhavāyā lakṣaṇam). (Correspondingly), wearing the tilaka and so on is the defining mark of the woman whose husband is alive (suvā- sinīnām lakṣaṇam).'76 The image is drawn from the division of

the year into two parts: dakṣināyana, when the sun ‘abides in' (or, more accurately, when the ecliptic tends towards) the south, during which time the days become shorter and the nights longer; and the uttarāyaṇa, when the sun 'abides in' the north and the days become longer once more. In dakṣināyana, the sun sets in a more southerly direction, leaving the northern sky dark. At such times, the northern direction, bereft of the sun's rays, does not 'shine'. Similarly, a wife whose husband has died is bereft of the tilaka mark that radiates her good fortune and so she too, as it were, no longer shines. 
In order to put these rulings concerning the tilaka for women into perspective, let us consider the equivalent rulings for men. In the Viramitrodaya (Vīr.Ā.p.248-52) and in the Smṛtimuktā- phala (Sm.M.II,p.292–310), for example, elaborate rules are laid down for the marks to be made on a man's forehead after his bath. Whether called tilaka or pundra(ka), these are evidently sectarian marks intended to indicate the religious persuasion of the wearer. The urdhvapundra or urdhvatilaka (a vertical mark of one or more lines) indicates the follower of Visnu; the tripundra (three horizontal lines) that of Śiva. According to the Smrticandrikā, the urdhva- pundra may be made with earth taken from a selection of sacred spots such as the top of a mountain or the bank of a sacred river. There are rulings on how the mark should be made (with which fingers, etc.), what it should look like, and on which twelve parts of the body it should be placed (on the forehead, chest, throat, arms, etc.; Sm. C.II.pp.302 ff.; Vṛddhahārītasmṛti II.58-72). Sankh.gr.II.10.6 gives the five parts of the body that should be marked with the tripundra in sacred ash. Elsewhere, we read that the urdhvapundra is made with earth after one's bath; the tripundra with sacred ash after performing homa; the (circular) tilaka in sandalwood paste after worshipping the gods (devapūjā; PVK II.i.p.673). There are even rulings on the size and shape of the tilaka or puṇḍra according to a man's varna : like a bamboo leaf for a brahmin; like a fish for a kṣatriya: smaller still for a vaiśya; and like a half-moon for a sūdra (Vīramitrodaya on Yājñ.1.20-21; Gharpure 1936). 
Tryambaka's section on the tilaka for women explains none of this. The sectarian marks so important to men are deemed irrelevant to their wives. In the next quotation from Vasistha (see below), there is a brief reference to the pundraka or sectarian mark; but that is all. The remaining references to the tilaka have no relation 
 
100 
Stridharmapaddhati 
to either Visnu or Śiva. The mark is made with neither sacred earth, sacred ash, nor sandalwood paste, but with kunkuma, the sign of a woman's marital happiness or saubhagya. For the tilaka is the visible symbol of a woman's religious allegiance as distinct from that of men. It declares first that her husband is her deity; secondly, that he is still alive to receive her daily service and worship. As we have seen, the bulk of the rulings on a woman's appearance carry the same message: her husband lives; all religious devotion must be directed to him alone. A man without his sectarian mark is a man without a god; a woman without her tilaka is one whose god is dead. 
The next four slokas are also taken from the Dharmākūta; in both texts, they are attributed to the Vasiṣṭhasamhitā. “The short bodice (kañcuki), the marriage necklace (kanthasūtram), a pair of earrings, collyrium, glass bangles, anointing with turmeric (haridrā) and putting the sectarian mark (pundraka) on the forehead, arrang- ing the hair, wearing ornaments on one's feet and nose, betel and so on-all these are declared to be the marks of women who have been blessed with good fortune (punyayoṣitām; i.e. they are not widows). If a woman wears glass ornaments at wrist and throat, her behaviour is meritorious; and her cooking is said to be pure.' 77 'If she does not wear glass ornaments at wrist and throat, she is understood to be a widow (i.e. in this life) and (she will also become a widow) in life after life.'78 
Glass bangles (a late development; cf. Altekar 1978:298) are another indispensable sign of the married woman whose husband is alive. When he dies, she breaks them (e.g. Wood 1980:172; Jameson 1976:251; etc.). The ritual purity of a woman's cooking is important for eating itself; for the ritual of eating (see Paräskara's Bhojanasūtra, traditionally learned by heart and followed to the

letter by young initiates; LSJ); and for the ritual of offering food to the deity. The cooking of a high-caste married woman whose husband is living is pure. If she is menstruating, however, it is not; hence the prohibition (see section IV, p. 284). In the case of a widow, in Maharashtra as in other parts of India, if she shaves her head, her cooking is deemed pure; if she does not, it is un- acceptable (LSJ). To say that a woman wears glass bangles and necklace is thus to say that her husband is alive; that in turn is a mark of her virtue and purity; hence her cooking is pure. 
Nose- and toe-rings seem to be another late development. Altekar notes the conspicuous absence of the nose-ring in sculpture and painting throughout India before the Muslim invasions. He concludes that it was originally a Muslim ornament (1978:301 ff.; cf. PVK II.i.537). By the time of Tryambaka, however, it was another indispensable sign of saubhagya. 
To conclude, the rules on dress for a man classify him in religious terms. The sacred thread is a mark of the twice-born, one who has undergone initiation followed by years of religious education. The colours of his garments and the way they are worn show his varna. The symbols on his forehead mark his sectarian allegiance. These are the signs of the religious status of a man, his reward for merit accumulated in past lives, and so now his innate virtue and purity. Similarly, the rules on dress for a woman classify her in religious terms, but in a markedly different way. That she is a woman is itself a demerit earned in a previous life (see section III, pp. 246– 72). All the rulings on dress, however, imply compensatory merits. Her entire appearance, from the flowers in her hair to the rings on her toes, signify that her personal deity is alive. That in itself is proof of her religious virtue, her ritual purity and thus of her authority in the home.

Serving the sacred fire (agniśuśrūṣā; Sdhp. 7v.9-10r.6) 
The word suśruṣā is well chosen. In this context, it is a general term denoting the practical aspects of the fire sacrifice. It thus covers both the śrauta and grhya rituals detailed below. Secondly, it carries with it all the associations of religious service and devotion. For example, the brahmin who chooses to be a perpetual student is instructed to 'serve' his teacher diligently all his life (paricaret, Manu II.243; glossed by Sarv. as suśruṣet). If his teacher dies, then he should 'serve' his teacher's son, his widow or sapinda relation (Manu II.247; guruvac chuśrūṣām anutiṣṭhet, Kull.). If none of these are alive, he should spend the rest of his life 'serving' the sacred fire (agniśuśruṣā; Manu II.248). Thirdly, the term reinforces the associations of obedience, subservience and attentiveness suggested by bhartṛ- śuśrūṣā ('serving one's husband'), already established as the single most important goal for women (see Tryambaka's introduction, section I, pp. 29–43). These ideas are further explained in Tryam- baka's detailed definition of the term in his conclusion (section V, especially pp. 312–13). 
Strictly speaking, the term agnihotra denotes the Vedic ritual of fire sacrifice described in detail in the śrautasūtras (see Dumont 1939). It involves three fires (treta; i.e. the āhavanīya, gārhapatya and dakṣināgni), takes place in a special enclosure, and consists primarily of an oblation (homa) of cow's milk into the āhavanīya fire twice daily, at sunset and at dawn. Only those who have reached a certain age ('when he has a son and his hair is still black', 
Sab. on Jai.1.3.3; but cf. Trik. 1.78c-9b) and who are rich enough to pay for the priests, may set up the three srauta fires. Once a man has done so, he is required to perform the twice-daily sacrifice for the rest of his life as a householder. The morning and evening oblations are in fact two halves of one ritual. In essence, this is a magical rite to ensure the continued passage of the sun through the heavens ('un charme solaire', Dumont 1939:viii). The evening performance is thus of particular importance since it marks the sun's disappearance and determines its return the following day. The apparent emphasis on the morning oblation is probably due to the fact that the dis- cussion of the proper time for the ritual traditionally revolves around 
 
At Dawn 
103 
that morning performance (Bodewitz 1976:3). In fact, the correct time of the oblation varies (depending on the text) from just before to just after sandhyā (‘juncture', i.e. sunset or sunrise; e.g. Āp.śr. VI.4. 7-9; Katy.śr.IV.14.6, IV.15.1,12-15). The first oblation in the morning is offered to Surya; the first in the evening to Agni; the second in both cases to Prajā pati. 
The term sayamprātarhoma denotes the simpler grhya counterpart of the śrauta ritual, as described in the grhyasutras and later smṛtis. It involves the single domestic fire (gṛhyāgni; also called aupāsana, vaivāhika, smärta, etc.); and consists of an oblation (homa) of cooked food such as boiled rice or barley (Aśv.gr.1.2.1; Āp.gr.III. 7.19; Gobh.Sm.I.131, III.114). Like its srauta equivalent, it is offered in two parts, evening and morning (hence sayampratarhoma), with similar differences of opinion as to the precise time. The single or aupāsana fire is established by every ritually independent male, whether this independence is marked by the end of his studentship (for one who does not return to the joint family), his marriage (if that does not immediately follow the former), the death of his father (in the case of the eldest son) or the partition of the joint family (for younger sons; Sankh.gr.I.1.2-5; Gobh.gr.I.1.7.12; Măn.gr.II.1.1). A particular age or degree of wealth is not stipu- lated. Thus if a man is unable for reasons of time or money to perform the more complex and costly śrauta ritual of agnihotra, he should perform the simpler aupāsana ritual. If he has the choice, he should choose the former (Sm.C.II.p.412-13). According to some texts, he might even do both, in which case there arises the problem of which should be performed first (e.g. Katy.śr.IV.13.12 and comm.). According to the Trikāṇḍamaṇḍana, there are two views on the kindling of the śrauta fires: that it is obligatory (nitya), and that it need only be done in order to obtain certain desires (kāmya, Trik.1.6); the latter view is ascribed to Baudhāyana (Trik.I.7). Failure to perform either ritual, out of unbelief or idleness, takes one to a variety of hells (Sm.C.II.p.417). The deities to whom the ob- lations are offered in the sayamprātarhoma are the same as those in the śrauta agnihotra: Surya, Agni and Prajapati. 
Is Tryambaka concerned with the srauta or the gṛhya ritual, or with both? To answer this question, I shall consider one of his rulings out of sequence. Sdhp.8r.5-6 informs us that, according to Manu, 'the (householder's) wife should perform (these) three rituals daily: service (suśrūṣā) relating to the agnihotra ritual; samdhyā or twilight 
 
104 
Stridharmapaddhati 
worship; and the obligatory bali offerings.'1 Does this reference to the agnihotra indicate an exclusive interest in srauta ritual, or is it being used more loosely here to cover both forms of the fire sacri- fice? 
Tryambaka certainly begins with rulings that only make sense in the context of the śrauta ritual. In Sdhp.8r.1-4, for example, he describes the layout of the traditional agnihotra enclosure (see below, p. 120, notes 11, 12). In Sdhp.8v.9, he explains that the wife should take her place after the uddharaṇam; that is, after coals have been taken from the garhapatya fire to light the other srauta fires (see p.130, note 25 below). In Sdhp. 9v.3-5, however, he informs us that the ruling just given on the close link between the wife and the sacred fires of the agnihotra ritual is equally applicable to the aupāsana ritual (see p. 140, note 40). He thus seems to differentiate between the śrauta and smärta fire sacrifice, and to cover both. 
In fact, the obvious parallels between śrauta and smärta fire rituals have created a confusing overlap in terms and concepts (cf. Bodewitz 1976:191 ff.). Ap.1.4.14.1, for example, gives agnihotra first in the list of ritual obligations to be fulfilled by the newly- married man (cf. also Āp.I.4.13.22). In this context, the term must mean the morning and evening offerings into the grhya fire (sāyam- prātarhoma). For, as indicated above, the śrauta ritual is open only to those who have reached a certain age and position; it is certainly not an automatic requirement of the householder (but cf. Trik.I.78c- 9b). The establishment of the grhya fire, on the other hand, often coincides with the marriage ceremony. The aupāsana fire ritual is presumably called agnihotra merely to give it the higher ritual status. For the same reason, Hir.gr.I.26.3 declares that the man who makes offerings in the grhya fire is held to be an ähitāgni (i.e. one who has set up the three srauta fires). (Mātṛdatta omits this chapter in his commentary, which suggests that it is in fact a later addition.) 
It is therefore unwise to assume that Tryambaka's references to the agnihotra always indicate the śrauta ritual. As we shall see, some of them most certainly do. But his stress on the importance of fire worship, without any provisos regarding the age, wealth and

105 
so on of the householder concerned, suggests that Tryambaka's main interest is in the ritual responsibilities of the wife of the inde- pendent householder and not merely with those of the wife of the ähitāgni. Tryambaka professes to have written a treatise on the religious duties of Hindu women. The text itself reveals that his interest is limited to orthodox women of the three higher varnas, in particular to those at court. A further restriction to the wives of āhitāgnis is unlikely. 
The term samdhya means literally the 'juncture' between night and day, thus the twilight periods of dawn and dusk; a third ‘junc- ture' is that between morning and afternoon, hence midday. In the context of ritual, the term denotes the religious acts performed by twice-born men at these two (e.g. Gaut.I.2.16–17; Manu II.101; Yājñ.I.24-5) or three (e.g. Apar.p.49; Sm. C.II.p.354; Vidyārṇava 1979:32) junctures of the day, hence the 'twilight ritual' or 'prayer' (samdhyopāsanam, samdhyāvandanam). As already shown, sam- dhyopāsanam is one of the three ritual responsibilities Tryambaka stipulates for the orthodox Hindu wife (see note 1). But precisely what does he mean by this? 
First, what is normally meant by samdhyopāsanam? The principal component is the repeated recitation (japa) of mantras, primarily the gayatri preceded by om and the three vyähṛtis. Subsidiary components include sipping (acamana); ritual breathing (prānā- yāma; lit. ‘restraint of the breath'); sprinkling with water (märjana); a ritual to drive out sin (aghamarṣaṇa; i.e. removing the sin of the preceding night or day; cf. Manu II. 102); offering water to the sun (arghyadāna); and the worship of Surya in the morning or Varuna in the evening (upasthāna). Each of these also involves the recitation of Vedic mantras (PVK II.i.p.314-19; Vidyarṇava 1979:32-41). The proper setting for the ritual is outside the village (Āp.I.11.30.8; Gaut.II.16; aranye, Śankh.gṛ.II.9.1); in particular, by a river, in the shade of an aśvattha tree, or in a similar sacred place (Baudh.gr.II.4.2). Only the agnihotrin who must perform the śrauta ritual at sunrise in his house may perform the samdhyā at home (Ujj. on Ap.I.11.30.9). The morning ritual is performed standing, the evening one sitting (Gaut.II.17; Sm.C.II.p.352-3). 
The parallels with both the śrauta ritual of agnihotra and the smārta ritual of sāyamprātarhoma are obvious. All three rituals are performed morning and evening (the midday samdhyā is often omitted); all three involve an offering to Surya and invocations to 
 
106 
Stridharmapaddhati 
both fire and the sun; all three are in origin magical rites to ensure the continued rising and setting of the sun. The aghamarṣaṇa ritual to remove sin recalls a similar interpretation of the agnihotra (see Bodewitz 1976: 153 ff.). So close are these parallels, and so prevalent the current custom of twilight worship, that Gonda maintains that the modern ritual of samdhyopāsanam has not only borrowed from the Vedic ritual of agnihotra but has replaced it (1970:74). Certainly, the adoration of the sun is an important part of the śrauta ritual. Gonda's remark is even more persuasive if the term samdhyā is taken to denote not merely the twilight prayers but the full morning or evening ritual (agnihotrahoma or sāyamprātarhoma) that normally follows them (see below). In this context, it is interesting to note that when the Smṛtimuktāphala quotes the sloka given above con- cerning the three ritual responsibilities of the orthodox wife (see note 1), the term samdhyopāsanam is glossed as sāyamprātarhoma, the grhya counterpart of the agnihotra (Sm.M.II. p. 355). We may conclude that there is a further confusing overlap of terms. 
Secondly, what is the proper time for the performance of the ritual? This question is approached in two ways: in relation to the actual time of sunset or sunrise (thus creating a further parallel to the discussions of agnihotra and sayamprātarhoma); and in relation to the morning fire sacrifice (thus clearly differentiating between homa and samdhyā). For example, the morning samdhyā ideally begins before sunrise and continues until the sun appears; the evening samdhya begins as the sun sets and continues until the stars appear (Aśv.gr.III.7.3-6; Har. on Gaut.I.2.17; Sm.C.II. p. 352-3). While Vidyarṇava specifies an exact time of forty-eight minutes for each ritual (1979:32), according to Manu the longer the time spent the better since it brings long life, fame and so forth (Manu IV.93-4). Alternatively, it should be performed after one's morning ablutions (Yajñ.I.98) and before the homa offering (Dakṣa II.28.2; Sm.C.II.p.422).2 In the case of the man who performs both the śrauta and the smärta ritual of homa, the samdhyā ritual should be performed before either of them (Kāty.śr.IV.13.12 and comm.). 
Now it is obvious that a lengthy samdhyā would make it difficult

107 
for the householder to perform the homa ritual at the right time, that is, at dawn. In fact, according to Manu II.15 (cf. also Sm.C.II. p.426), the morning sacrifice (yajñaḥ; glossed as agnihotrahomaḥ) may take place either before or after sunrise (udite 'nudite caiva) or somewhere in between the two (samayadhyuşite; glossed by Medhätithi as 'at dawn'; by Kulluka as 'when neither sun nor stars can be seen'). Some authorities insist that the ceremony must be completed before the sun has risen 'by one hand's length' (hastād urdhvam) above the horizon (Gobh.Sm.I.122–3; Sm.C.II.p.426); others allow that it may be performed until the end of the morning period (samgava, see p. 45; cf. Āśv.gr.1.9.5 and comm.; Sm.C.II.p. 426). Either way, the difficulty of trying to perform two rituals at roughly the same time remains. Usually, as reported above, the samdhyā is performed first; sometimes it is performed after the homa ritual. 
Tryambaka evidently prefers the latter. After his comments on the morning ablutions (see section IIA, pp.69-88, and the clothes and ornaments a woman should wear (see pp.88-101), he moves straight on to deal with the morning fire ritual (agniśuśruṣā). Only when he has done that, does he give a series of rulings on arghyadānam, one of the subsidiary components of the samdhyā ritual (see below, pp. 149–55). 
The role of the wife 
Before continuing with Tryambaka's discussion of the fire sacrifice, I shall take another of his rulings out of sequence. It concerns his definition of agniśuśrūṣā in relation to women. What exactly is the wife permitted or expected to do? 'At the time of the oblation,' Tryambaka explains, 'the wife should serve the sacred fire in the sense that she should do such things as adorning (the hearth).'3 By this, he presumably means such things as cleaning the area and decorating it with powder designs, flowers and so forth. It is re- markable that this is virtually all Tryambaka tells us about what the wife is actually required to do. 
In my comment on Tryambaka's introduction (see section I), I touched briefly on the issue of a woman's right to offer sacrifice. The exclusion of women from Vedic education and upanayana, 
3. homasamaye patnya agner alankārādiṣuṣrūṣā kartavyā // Sdhp.8r.4–5. 
 
108 
Strīdharmapaddhati 
combined with the growing tendency to deny the modification (ūha) of gender, led to an almost unanimous rejection of that right. According to Manu, for example, the sacrifice performed by a woman is displeasing to the gods and inauspicious for men; a brahmin may not eat the food offered there (Manu IV. 205–6). It is argued (e.g. in Manu XI.37) that the person who performs the sacrifice must be skilled in srauta ritual (vaitānakuśalaḥ; glossed by Rāgh. as srautakarmakusalah) and thoroughly versed in the Veda (vedapäragah). It follows that if a girl (kanyā) or a young woman whether married or not (yuvatih; glossed by Kull. as anūḍhā ūḍhāpi taruṇī) performs the agnihotra sacrifice, she will go to hell; as indeed will an insufficiently educated or uninitiated or foolish man (Manu XI.36-7; cf. Sm.C.II.p.424; yet cf. pp.141-9 below). In V.155, Manu goes further still: no sacrifice (yajña), no ritual observance (vrata), and no fast (upoṣaṇa) may be performed by a woman separately (prthak; glossed by Sarv. as bhartrā vinā; i.e. independently of her husband). Vis.Sm.XXV.15-16 adds that a woman who observes such a fast or vrata during her husband's lifetime will deprive him of long life and will herself go to hell. 
It is evident from such examples that the main thrust of orthodox opposition is ranged against the independent religieuse (see Leslie 1980:27 ff.; 1983(1): 100). It is not necessarily intended to prevent the orthodox high-caste wife from taking her legitimate part in religious ritual jointly with her husband. In fact, as Jaimini declares, husband and wife are jointly entitled to perform the sacrifice and so should do it together (ekakarmyam; Jai.VI.1.17). But what exactly is the wife's role in such ritual acts? If we examine the rulings on precisely this issue of the joint ritual duties of husband and wife, we find that here too the role of the wife is gradually whittled away. 
R.V.VIII.31.5, for example, is quite explicit. Husband and wife are joint sacrificers. Together they press out the soma juice (sunutaḥ; glossed as somābhiṣavam kurutaḥ, v.5); together they approach the sacrificial grass (barhih; glossed as yajñam, v.6); together they invite the gods to the sacrificial feast in order to attain immortality (amṛ- tāya; glossed as amaraṇāya samtānābhivṛddhaye, v.9). Sāyaṇa comments that this is a hymn of praise to the married couple performing a sacrifice (vajane dampatyoḥ; or, in the phrase of some MSS, yajamānadampatyoh). He glosses dampatī as 'the two per- formers of sacrifice, that is, husband and wife' (yajñakāriņau jāyāpatī). The Taittirīyabrāhmaṇa intones: may husband and wife become one through their joint good deeds (sam patnī patyā sukṛtena 
 
At Dawn 
109 
gacchatām); may they, yoked like oxen, bear together the burden of the sacrifice (yajñasya dhuryāyuktāvibhūtām); may they jointly destroy their enemies; and share the rewards in heaven (Tait.Br. III.7.5.11; Śab. on Jai.VI.1.2.). 
According to Ap.II.5.11.17, a man needs a wife for two reasons: to bear him children and to perform the religious rituals that must be performed jointly with a wife (prajāsahatvakarmabhyah). A wife who takes part in the kindling of the agnihotra fire with her husband becomes permanently associated with the rituals connected with it (karmabhiḥ sambadhyate; v.14). It is for this reason that, as long as she performs her part in the joint sacrifice and bears children (dharmaprajāsampanne däre), her husband may not take a second wife (v.12; according to the Ujjvalā, this means she must bear sons). Moreover, a wife who fulfils her religious obligations (dharmasam- pattih) is one who is both conscientious about and capable of (śraddha saktiś ca) the required śrauta and smärta rituals (śrauteșu gārhyeṣu smärtesu ca karmasu; Ujj. on v.12). 
By playing her part, the wife obtains an equal share in the rewards of the sacrifice. Thus, in the Buddhacarita, when the Buddha- to-be abandons his orthodox Hindu wife, she laments that he is depriving her of her legitimate share in the merit obtained by joint sacrifice. She maintains that he has no right to pursue a religious path, either in the home or in the forest, without her (VIII.61–2). For the married couple (dampatī) is initiated together (dīkṣitāv ubhau; i.e. in the kindling of the sacred fire); purified together by the performance of Vedic rituals (vedavidhānasamskṛtau); and therefore destined to enjoy the same rewards after death (samam bubhukṣū parato 'pi tatphalam; VIII.63). 
Even Manu, whose extremist pronouncements on women are well known, insists that the wife is ordained to take part in joint religious rituals. According to Manu IX.28, for example, a man relies on his wife for five essential things: children, religious rituals (dharma- kāryāṇi; glossed by Ragh. as balyagnihotrādīni, ‘the bali offering, the fire sacrifice, and so on'), obedient service (śuśrūṣā), sexual pleasure, and (the reward of) heaven for both himself and his ancestors. Manu IX. 96 explains that, since women were created to have children (prajanärtham; glossed alternatively as 'conception', 'pregnancy' or ‘childbirth') and men to continue their line (sam- tānārtham; glossed as 'impregnating' and 'implanting the seed'), the religious duties applicable to all (sādhārano dharmaḥ) should be performed jointly by husband and wife. Medhātithi comments that 
 
110 
Stridharmapaddhati 
a man has no authority to act alone (ataḥ kevalasyādhikārābhāvāt); hence even wives who deserve to be hated (dveṣyah) should not be abandoned (i.e. superseded). 
Similar sentiments abound in the epics and purāṇas. The wife is frequently referred to as 'one who shares in her husband's religious duties' (sahadharmacarī; e.g. Mbh. XIII.134.7a; Ram.II.117.30b; etc.). Sītā is portrayed performing a number of rituals jointly with Rāma before his installation as heir presumptive (Ram.II.5-6). She even takes part in Dasaratha's śraddha ceremony together with Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa (Rām.II.103). The Märkandeyapurāna con- cludes that a man cannot fulfil his religious duties to gods, ancestors and guests without a wife: for the wife shares the sacrifice, bears the children and prepares the food (21.70–2). 
According to Pāṇini, this participation in the sacrifice is indicated in the word patnī. For the feminine form of pati (‘owner', ‘lord', 'husband') is simply patī. When the final i of patī is replaced by n before the feminine suffix ī, it denotes a wife 'related through sacri- fice' (vajñasamyoge), thus one who takes part in the sacrifices of her husband (Pāṇ.IV.1.33). Since the sudra is not entitled to perform sacrifices, his wife may not be called patnī, or is called so only by analogy (upamānāt siddham; Pat. on Pan.IV.1.33). When Jaimini declares that the patni is entitled to perform sacrifices because she is 'closely connected with wealth' (arthena ca samavetatvat; Jai. VI.1.14), he is taking the term in this most literal sense of 'female owner'. As the chief wife of equal caste, the patnī is the joint owner of wealth and thus meets the stipulations required of the performer of sacrifice (cf. Jai.VI.1.10; see section I). Since the wealth required for the sacrifice is in fact common to both husband and wife, they should perform the sacrifice together (Jai.VI.1.17). 
The purvamīmāmsă material is illuminating in many respects. For example, in his commentary on Jai.VI.1.17, Śabara explains that certain important rituals such as the darśapūrṇamāsa (new and full moon ceremonies) and the jyotistoma (a class of soma ritual) would be ineffective if either the wife or the husband did not parti- cipate. In the cases he cites, both sacrificer and patnī must gaze at the ghee.4 But how active, and how important, is the latter's partici- pation in other rituals? 
4. Gazing at the ghee (äjyāvekṣaṇa) is one of several actions to be per- formed by the wife in the darsapurṇamāsa ritual; cf. Smith 1984:576–7.

111 
Certainly, in several Vedic rites, the wife plays both an active and an essential role. In the horse-sacrifice (aśvamedha), for example, four (or three) of the king's wives (mahişi, the consecrated queen; vāvātā, the favourite; parivṛktī, the neglected one who has borne no son; and pālāgalī, the low-born wife) anoint the horse and weave pearls into its mane and tail (Śat.Br.XIII.2.6.4-8; Katy.śr.XX. 5.15-17; Dumont 1948:480). When it has been killed (samjña- panam; Katy.śr.XX.6.10), they circumambulate the horse nine times, fanning it as they walk (Katy.śr.XX.6.12-13; Sat.Br.XIII. 2.8.2-4; Dumont 1948:482). In the Rāmāyaṇa, the queen de- capitates the animal herself (Rām.I.14.33-5). She then lies beside the horse under the cover of a garment and simulates sexual inter- course with it (āśvasisnam upasthe kurute, Katy.śr.XX.6.16; yonipradese, comm.; Baudh.śr.15.29). After a ritual exchange of abuse, the queens dissect the animal with special needles (Kāty. śr.XX.7.1-2). Similarly, in the ceremony of the king's consecration (räjasūya), three of his wives (mahiṣī, vāvātā and parivṛktī) are among the people of importance to the king to whom the 'jewel- offerings' (ratnahavis) are given (Sat.Br.V.3.4,13; Tait.Sam.I.8.9; Heesterman 1957:49–57). In the väjapeya (lit. 'drink of strength') ritual, the sacrificer's wife (wearing a skirt of kusa grass to counter the effects of her impure lower half) accompanies her husband in a symbolic joint ascent to heaven (Sat.Br.V.2.1.8-11). In the soma sacrifice, she ritually cleanses the animal about to be sacrificed (Śat.Br.III.8.2.1-6); makes the foundation brick for the fire-altar (Sat.Br.VI.5.3.1); and at one time she may even have chanted the sāman verses now sung by the udgātṛ (Sat.Br.XIV.1.35). For the wife is the 'bottom half' (jaghanärdhā, Sat.Br.III.8.2.2; V.2.1.8) of the sacrifice, half the sacrificer's own self (Sat.Br.V.2.1.10). As Sabara comments on Jai.VI.1.18, statements such as 'he binds the wife with a rope and the sacrificer with a girdle in order to make them a couple' (mithunatvāya; Tait.Sam. VI.1.3.5) only make sense if the sacrifice is performed jointly by husband and wife. 
In theory then, the patnī is as much a sacrificer as her husband. But, as Śabara also explains, the ritual function of the wife is totally different from that of the male sacrificer: hers is a necessarily sup- portive role. Her participation therefore does not in any way dis- turb the 'singleness' (ekatvam) of the sacrificer (Śab. on Jai.VI.1.17). This point is picked up in Jai.VI.1.22 and 23. It seems that some theorists argued that the dual number in the joint sacrifice refers not 
112 
Strīdharmapaddhati 
to the husband and his wife but to two men (dvayoh pumsor adhi- kāraḥ, Śab. on Jai.VI.1.22; e.g. the sacrificer and the priest). Jaimini disagrees. The sacrifice is performed by one man not two (ekaḥ pumān ādadhīta na dvau; Śab. on Jai.VI.1.23); the dual number indicates the 'quality' of the single man (guṇasya tu vidhā- natvāt; Jai.VI.1.23); the word 'second' thus denotes the wife (patnya dvitiyaśabdaḥ syat; Jai.VI.1.23). The Vedic 'sacrificing couple' is reduced to a male sacrificer with his female 'second'. It is clear which way the trend is going.5 
Having established the essential 'singleness' of the male sacri- ficer in the joint sacrifice, the next question concerns which acts should be performed by the man alone, and which by his assistant wife. Jai.VI.1.24 explains. Since the wife is not equal (atulyatvāt; i.e. to the husband), she should perform only those acts which are specifically laid down in the Veda for her to do (tasyā yāvad uktam; cf. Śab., vacanaprāmānyāt), such as the invocation of blessings and celibacy (āśīr brahmacaryam). I have already noted that Jaimini does not in fact maintain that women are not entitled to study the Veda (see section I). He merely insists that in the joint sacrifice the wife is 'not equal'. But all later commentators, from Sabara on- wards, gloss this vague 'inequality' in terms of Vedic education, or rather the lack of it. The sacrificer is a man and therefore learned in the Veda (yajamānaḥ pumān vidvāmś ca); whereas the wife is a woman and therefore not learned (patnī strī ca avidyā ca; 
Sab. on Jai.IV.I.24). 
Oddly enough, Sabara does not take exception to the term āsīḥ, 'the invocation of blessings', that is, Vedic mantras. Kumārila, in his commentary, the Tupṭīkā, does. According to him, the wife, being without Vedic education, would be unable to pronounce the mantras correctly (but cf. section I above). The term āsīḥ must therefore be reinterpreted to mean 'embellishments' (samskārāḥ) such as bathing, anointing, applying collyrium and so on. Even the term brahmacarya (celibacy) must be reinterpreted to mean 'freedom from all passions' (Kum.Ṭu.VI.1.24; Jha 1934:993). Lesser things

The secondary importance of the patni and the passivity of her ritual role is exemplified in two photographs in Staal's analysis of the agnicayana ritual as performed by Nambudiri brahmins in 1975. She sits beside her husband, in a semicircle with the priests, but her head and body are bowed low behind a large umbrella so that—as antarjanam ('inside person')— she is hidden from view (Staal 1983:1, pp. 314-15, plates 45A, 45B; see also p. 383, plate 62).

laid down for the wife to do, such as gazing at the ghee (e.g. Śab. on Jai.VI.1.17, see above; Ap.śr.II.6.6), may be interpreted literally. Sandal is so influenced by later views on the matter that he trans- lates even Jaimini's reference to āsīḥ as 'paring of the nails', com- menting that the term covers the shaving of the head and face as well. He does add, however, that other commentators have taken āśīh to mean Vedic benedictions (Sandal 1974 on Jai.VI.1.24). Tryambaka, on the other hand, follows Kumārila. But, for him, the transition from Vedic mantras (āsīḥ) to 'embellishments' (samskārāḥ) no longer requires explanation. He merely states that the wife's service to the fire implies ‘adorning and so on' (alankärādi).

This issue of the right (adhikara) of the wife to perform sacri- fice is discussed at some length in the first kända or 'section' of the Trikāṇḍamandana, Bhaskara Miśra's exposition of the soma- yaga aphorisms of Apastamba, also known as the Āpastamba- sūtradhvanitārthakārikā. Bhaskara Miśra wrote at a time when it was evidently still possible to assert that, according to some, the wife was equally and jointly responsible for the sacrifice (before A.D. 1100 according to PVK.I.i.p.551; in the eleventh or twelfth century A.D. according to Smith, 1984:75-80). Judging by the repeated juxtaposition of unreconciled opposing views, however, this pro- duced an uncomfortable ambivalence. 
The section on the adhikara of the wife opens by presenting three distinct views. According to the first, all the specifications (lakṣaṇaḥ) enjoined for the sacrificer, except the traditional learning of the Veda (svādhyāyamātram tyaktva), are applicable to all the sacri- ficer's wives (Trik.I.43). According to the second, the sacrificer shares these rights regarding the sacrifice only with his chief wife (savarnaya jyeṣṭhabharyayaiva). According to the third, the sacri- ficer may not share these rights with a wife married solely for pleasure (kāmapatni) after the śrauta fires have been lit (Trik.I.44). Trik.I.45 then declares that the adhikāra of the married couple acting together in the sacrifice (dampatyor ubhayor mithah) is indeed equal (tulya eva). In accordance with this view, even the ability (kartṛtvam) to make sacrificial offerings (dravyatyāge) is equal (Trik.I.46a). (The term tyaga denotes the ritual renunciation of the fruit of the offering by the sacrificer and the assigning of that fruit

to the relevent deity.) In the context of an optional rite (kāmyatve), the ritual should be performed if either husband or wife have a particular desire (Trik.I.53a). According to an alternative view ascribed to Rudradatta (comm. on Trik.I.46b), however, the husband actually makes the offering (tyagam patiḥ kuryāt) while his wife merely ‘approves' it (patnī tam anumanyate; glossed as anujānā- ti, 'she gives her consent'); hence their inequality in the sacrifice (adhikāre 'pi vaiṣamyam; Trik.I.47a). What is meant by the wife's 'approval' or 'consent' is unclear. Following this line of thought, the sacrificer has the entitlement (adhikāravān) with regard to the major offerings (prädhānyena) which are independent (svaniṣṭha; glossed as svatantra); while the wife, being dependent upon her husband (patni tatparatantrā satî) has the entitlement regarding sub- sidiary offerings (angabhūtādhikāriņi); hence the religious res ponsibilities of the husband are heavier (patidharmā balādhikāḥ; Trik.I.48). In the context of a kāmya rite, the ritual should be per- formed only if the husband is the one with the desire (Trik.I.53b). Bhaskara Miśra is evidently unwilling to endorse either of the two prevailing views. 
By the time of later commentators, however, all injunctions for the joint sacrifice that are not specifically given in the feminine form are taken to refer only to the male sacrificer, the husband. Even those expressed in the feminine are reinterpreted according to current notions of the religious inequality of women. This inequality is in turn justified by the insistence that women are not allowed to study the Veda. 
Against such a background, it is no surprise to read in the Mahā- bhārata that it is the wife's job to look after all the items her husband will need for the sacrifice (Mbh.XIII.47.32–4). According to Trik.III.100, some authorities disregard the patni altogether; the commentary explains that she is not so much a part (anga) of the sacrifice as a part of the sacrificer, for her position is akin to that of a sacrificial utensil (vajñāpātrāṇīva patnī; Smith 1984:128). So pas- sive is her role that the question of whether she need participate at all is raised. In Sita's absence, Rāma has a golden image of her made to symbolise their religious partnership in the horse-sacrifice (Răm.VII.91.25). The Aitareyabrähmana goes even further, asking if a man without a wife may offer the agnihotra. The conclusion is not only that he may, but that he should; for a man who fails to do so is a 'mock man' (anaddhāpurușa), that is, one who offers oblations

115 
to neither gods, ancestors or men (Ait.Br.32.8.p.824-5). Bodewitz (1976:119) translates the term anaddhāpuruşa as 'barbarian', taking it merely as a derogatory term. Sāyaṇa explains that such a man is 'false' (anṛtaḥ) by virtue of his failure to perform his sacri- ficial duty. In another context, he glosses the term as alīkapurușa, 'a false or counterfeit man' (on Sat.Br.VI.3.1.24; cf. S.B.E.XLI. p.197). Since the essential sacrificer even in the joint sacrifice is the male, failure to perform that sacrifice in the absence of a female 'second' merely shows that he is not a 'real' man. As Bodewitz points out (1976:119–21), a man without a wife (apatnīka) may be either a once-married man whose wife has died or disappeared, or a man who has never married. The latter alternative opens the way for the internalization of the sacrifice. The wife is substituted by faith (śraddhā; Ait.Br.32.8) or intellect (buddhi; Bodewitz 1976:121, note 10). The sacrificer now offers in and to the self. In the realm of dharmasastra, however, the substitute is a wife made of kuśa grass (upādhiś cātra kuśamayī patni) with whom a man may offer sacrifice for the rest of his life (Sm.C.II.p.442; Ait.Br.32.8.p.826; contrast Apar. on Yajñ.I.89.p.114-15). According to Trik.II.8, if the sacrificer's wife is absent, a wife of gold or kuśa grass (sauvarṇī kuśapatnī vā) may be substituted (cf. Trik.III.96); but the wife may never use such an image of her husband to perform the sacri- fice in his absence (patyuḥ pratinidhim kṛtvā patnī naivam samācaret). Tryambaka also deals with this question of whether the wife's presence and 'participation' is strictly necessary, and comes to the opposite conclusion (see below, pp. 132-41). For the moment, however, let us note simply that his ruling on the wife's duties in the joint sacrifice follows the trend of thought indicated by Śabara and Kumārila. In general terms, as Tryambaka explains in section IV, the good wife should be like Lopamudra, who takes her hus- band's religious duties as her own (pativrată, sadharmini) to the extent that she seems to be no more than her husband's shadow (tavāngacchāyayā tulyā; Sdhp.22v. 10ff.; cf. pp. 273-4, 281–2). In the context of the fire sacrifice, the patni's task is the supportive and peripheral one of decorating the hearth. 
Where the patni may walk 
Tryambaka opens his section on agniśuśrūṣā by giving two practical details: first, how the wife should enter the agnihotra hall or en- closure; secondly, where she is permitted to walk. 
 
116 
Stridharmapaddhati 
The first of these is a ruling specific to the patni. ‘For the purpose of the fire ritual, the wife should enter the agnihotra hall by its southern door." Tryambaka quotes from the Katyāyanaśrauta- sūtra. 'There are two doors, one to the east, another to the south; the husband enters by the eastern door, the wife by the southern one.'8 
These rulings indicate that Tryambaka is thinking primarily of the śrauta ritual involving three fires and taking place in a special enclosure (agnyagāra; Āp.śr.I.2.10). The ritual for setting up the sacred fires (agnyādheya, ādhana) gives details regarding the con- struction of this enclosure (cf. Śr.kosa I.i). Strictly speaking, two enclosures should be made (agnyagare kurvanti; Kāty.śr.IV. 7.8). First, a raised place is prepared, sloping towards the east (prācīnapravaṇam devayajanam; Ap.sr.V.4.1). Next, an east-west line is drawn. On this are marked the centres of the āhavanīya and gārhapatya fireplaces, the former to the east, the latter to the west. The āhavaniya or ‘oblatory' fire is kindled by fire brought from the gārhapatya, and the homa offering is performed in it (Katy.śr.IV. 8.24; 1.8.44). The garhapatya or 'domestic' fire (lit. 'belonging to the gṛhapati or master of the house') is kept permanently alight (Āp. śr.VI.2.13). The two fireplaces are built eight paces apart (aṣṭāsu prakrameşu) if the sacrificer is a brahmin, eleven if he is a kṣatriya, twelve if he is a vaiśya (Āp.śr.V.4.3). Around each fire an enclosure is built. The āhavanīya enclosure, with its rafters or roof poles (vamsa) pointing east, encloses only the āhavaniya fire. The gārha- patya enclosure, with its rafters pointing north, encloses both the gārhapatya fire and, south-east of that, the dakṣina or 'southern' fire (Katy.śr.IV.7.9; Āp.śr.V.4.2,5). These two enclosures are open to each other on the inside to form one larger unit. There are two entrances into this double fire-hall. The entrance into the ahavanīya enclosure is to the east; that into the garhapatya enclosure is to the south (Katy.śr.IV.7.10 and comm.) More specifically, the sacrificer (vajamānaḥ, Kāty.śr.comm; patiḥ, Tryambaka) should enter the āhavanīya fire-hall by the eastern door; the patnī should enter the gārhapatya fire-hall by the southern one (Katy.śr.IV.7.10 and

Additional information not supplied by Tryambaka in- cludes the shapes of the three fireplaces (the ahavaniya is square, the garhapatya circular, the dakṣina the shape of a halfmoon; see figure 7); and where the sacrificer and his wife should sit (the former to the south-west of the āhavanīya fire; the latter to the south-west of the garhapatya fire, facing north; Ap.śr.VI.5.1.2, II.5.2,8). 9

Figure 7. Layout of the ritual enclosure 
There are two main points of interest here. First, the ruling that the sacrificer and his wife should enter by different doors (Sdhp.7v.10– 8r.1 < Katy.śr.IV.7.10,19-20) seems to be contradicted by another ruling in Tryambaka's source that for the agnihotra ritual one should enter by the southern door (dakṣinena praveśanam agni- hotreṣṭiṣu; Kāty.śr.IV.15.29). According to the commentary, this applies to the priest, the sacrificer and the patni. The Satapatha- brāhmaṇa, however, agrees with the first ruling: the sacrificer should enter from the east (pūrveṇāhavanīyam parītya; Šat. Br.II.3.3.13); if he were to take his place after entering from the south, he would fail to reach heaven (Sat.Br.II.3.3.16). Neither Dumont nor Bode- witz draws attention to this apparent contradiction. Dumont gives only the second ruling (1939:2). Bodewitz assumes the first without

comment (1976:58-60 and note 5). The issue evidently needs further clarification. 
Secondly, Tryambaka's brief quotation reinforces a very common but significant set of identifications and associations: the sacri- ficer with the ahavaniya fire and the eastern direction; the patnī with the garhapatya fire and the south. Traditionally, heaven is identified with both the ahavaniya and the east. For example, Ait.Br.25.1 (p.648) declares that the āhavaniya is sacrifice (yajña), the āhavaniya is heaven (svarga). According to Sat.Br.XII.4.1.3, the āhavaniya is the other world (antarikṣaloka; i.e. the inter- mediate region between earth and sky). Elsewhere, the ahavaniya is the world of the gods (devaloka; Śat.Br.VII.3.1.10, XII.9.3.10). Similarly, Śat.Br.II.3.3.16 explains that when the sacrificer walks towards the east, he is moving towards the heavenly world and will thereby gain heaven. For the eastern direction is towards the gods (Śat.Br.VII.3.2.1; XIV.2.2.28), the region of the gods (Śat.Br.III. 1.1.2,6; cf. Gonda 1980:52-7). Correspondingly, the garhapatya is identified with the terrestrial world (ayam eva lokaḥ, Śat.Br.XII. 4.1.3; manuṣyalokaḥ, VII.3.1.10). Śat.Br.VII.1.1.3 and 7 explain that the garhapatya is the size of a man and the circular shape of the womb and the earth, for it is this terrestrial world (cf. Śat.Br.IX. 2.3.14). Unlike the 'divine' ahavaniya, the garhapatya fire is 'human' for it is the world of men (Sat.Br.VII.3.1.10). The roof poles of the gärhapatya enclosure point north for that is the region of men and the appropriate direction for an unconsecrated person (adīkṣitasya). Only for a consecrated person (dīkṣitasya) may the poles point east as in the ahavaniya enclosure (Sat.Br.III.1.1.7; III.6.4.12). The south, however, is the direction or world of the ancestors (Śat.Br. III.1.1.2; III.6.4.12; IX.3.4.11) and, by extension, of death itself (cf. Gonda 1980:52-7). Thus the sacrificer is associated with the gods and heaven; the patnī with men and the world of the ancestors. More dramatically, if the sacrificer entered from the south as the patnī does, he would fail to reach heaven (see above, Śat.Br.II. 3.3.16). Consequently, if she does reach heaven, it will not be on her own account but by virtue of her association with her husband. 
Tryambaka's second point concerns where the patnī is permitted to walk. ‘(Any) walking about in the agnihotra enclosure should be done along the sacred path (or place; tīrtha).'10 The quotation that 
10. agnihotragṛhe tīrthenaiva samcāraḥ kartavyah // Sdhp.8r.1. 
 
At Dawn 
119 
follows is not a ruling exclusive to women but a general one concer, ning any movement within the sacrificial area. First, however, it is necessary to give some explanation of the terms used. 
Tīrtha and samcara denote the special path (märga; comm. on Katy.śr.I.3.42) along which one may walk within the sacrificial area. For rituals involving an uttaravedi or northern altar-such as the varuṇapraghāsa, animal and soma sacrifices-it lies between the catvāla and the utkara (Katy.śr.1.3.42 and comm.; Ap.śr.XII. 5.4, Rudradatta comm.; Aśv.śr.I.1.6 and comm.). In all istis such as the new and full moon rituals, it lies between the pranītā and the utkara (Katy.śr.I.3.43; Aśv.śr.I.1.4,7 and frontispiece, Ān.). 
The catvāla is the trench or pit from which earth is taken to con- struct the mahāvedi or great altar (avaṭaḥ, comm. on Aśv.śr.I.1.6; cātvālāt purīṣam, comm. on Katy.śr.I.8.39). It is situated to the north-east of the altar (Sen 1982; plans 3,5,6). It is not included in Dumont's 'plan de la hutte et de l'emplacement du sacrifice' (1939:xv) nor in Sen's plan for the agnihotra, darsapurṇamāsa and işțis (1982: plan 4), presumably because it is not relevant in the agnihotra. In Staal's diagram of the elaborate agnicayana ritual, the catvāla is positioned on the northern boundary of the mahāvedi, to the north of the bird-altar and east of the utkara. It is not in- cluded in the smaller sacrificial hall appropriate for the simple agnihotra ritual (1983:1, endpapers, 262-3, 394; 398, plate 65). 
The utkara (‘rubbish heap') is a mound to the north of the altar (vedi or mahāvedi; Sen 1982: plans 3,4; Staal 1983:1, endpapers) where the earth required for constructing the altar is put (comm. on Aśv.śr.I.1.4, p.5). According to Staal, it is made in the shape of a turtle (1983:1, 258-9, plate 36B). Other discarded items such as darbha grass, and flowers and so on may also be placed there (comm. on Āp. śr.II.1.6-7). In the building of the fire-altar, for example, instructions are given that any imperfect or discoloured brick should be broken up and thrown on the utkara, the proper place for what is not needed (Sat.Br.VIII.7.2.16). 
The praṇītā is where specially purified water is kept in a water pot, to the north-east of the altar (comm. on Asv.śr.I.1.4, p.6; Sen 1982: plan 4; Dumont 1939:xv). It is called praṇītā because the water is 'brought forward' by the adhvaryu from the garhapatya fire to its 
place by the ahavanīya fire (Śat.Br.I.1.1.12-21). 
Tryambaka's version of all this is taken from the Baudhayana- dharmasutra and runs as follows. 'The sacred area (tīrtha) of (or 
 
120 
Strīdharmapaddhati 
path to) the sacrifice is between the catvāla and the utkara. (When coming) from the catvāla, (it lies) between the ahavaniya fire and the utkara. Until the ritual is over, the performers of the sacrifice (i.e. the priests), the sacrificer and his wife should walk there (i.e. only along that path). When the ritual is over, they may walk around in the area where there is no utkara (i.e. on the other side of the en- closure).'11 Tryambaka supplies his own glosses. 'Visamsthite means “as long as the ritual is not completed". Samcaraḥ means “entering and leaving". Samsthite means "once the ritual is com- pleted, that is, afterwards.' ""12 
The quotation is obviously a general one to be taken in so far as it is appropriate. Since the catvāla is not required for the agnihotra ritual, we may perhaps assume that the praṇītā is meant. Sen, in his diagram of the vedi for the agnihotra, darsapūrṇamāsa and istis, marks the samcaras of the sacrificer and the priests (Sen 1982: plan 4). That of the patni is missing. Tryambaka, however, includes it (cf. Katy.śr.IV.13.13 and comm.). 
When dealing with the various instructions concerning the right way to approach the sacrifice, it is important to distinguish between three kinds of entrance or approach. First, there are the two physical entrances into the sacrificial enclosure: the eastern and the southern doors (see above). Within the enclosure lies the vihāra (lit. ‘separa- tion', i.e. of the fires), the sacrificial area containing the three fires (comm. on Asv.śr.I.1.4, p.5). Before going to his place, the sacrificer should sip water from the place prescribed for sipping (acamana) inside the enclosure but outside the vihara (Aśv.śr., An., frontis- piece; Sen 1982: plan 4). The vihāra itself must be approached from the north (Baudh.1.7.15.1). Sat.Br.II.3.3.14 even declares that there is a door on the northern side. But this is misleading: there is no northern entrance to the enclosure; the door is a metaphorical one within it (Bodewitz 1976: 60, note 5). Once inside the enclosure, one should walk between the garhapatya and āhavanīya fires, thus ap-

proaching the vihāra from the north. In this context, the statement that one who enters from the south will miss the sacrificial 'boat' (literally, see Sat.Br.II.3.3.15-16) means not that the patni is barred from heaven (because she enters the enclosure from the south) but that once inside the enclosure everyone should approach the vihāra from the north. The third type of 'entrance' is that mentioned here by Tryambaka: the sacred path to the sacrifice from the north-east by which one may come and go during the ritual, the tīrtha or samcara. Following Katyāyana (patni ca pūrvavat; Katy.śr.IV.13. 13), we may assume that this last rule of entry applies to the patnī as it does to her husband (patny api yajamānavad eva samcarena pravisya; comm.). 
Which wife is the patni? 
Tryambaka evidently assumes that the patni should be present at the sacrifice, both for the morning and the evening rituals (cf. Ap.śr.VI.5.1; contrast Baudh.sr.III.4.8-9; Man.śr.1.6.2.16). After the two rulings already dealt with above (see notes 1,3), his next concern is the question of which wife should be accorded this privilege. Such a problem only arises in a polygamous household. 
In fact, although monogamy is usually presented as the ideal, polygamy seems always to have been practised, especially among royal or noble (i.e. wealthy) families. There are many references to it in the Rgveda. R.V.X.145, for example, is intended as a charm to wean the husband's affections away from a co-wife (cf. also R.V.X. 159; A.V.III.18). Śat.Br.XIII.4.1.9 refers to the four wives of the king, all of whom (including the pālāgalī, the low-born wife) have a part to play at the sacrifice (see above). Baudh.I.8.16.1-5 de- clares that a brahmin may marry four wives (i.e. one of each vama), a kṣatriya three, a vaisya two, and a sudra one; and then proceeds to discuss the mixture of caste that would result (cf. Manu III.13, v.14 refutes this; Vas.I.24-5). 
Yet Ap.II.5.11.12 forbids a man to take a second wife as long as the first is able to produce children and perform her part in the religious sacrifice. Verse 13 adds that if the first wife is deficient in these two important respects, then he may take another wife, as long as he does so before the sacrificial fires are kindled (prāg agnyādheyāt). For Manu IX.81, the major point at issue is the wife's ability to bear sons: if she is barren (vandhyā), she may be superseded in the eighth year; if her children all die (mṛtaprajā), in 
122 
Stridharmapaddhati 
the tenth; if she bears only daughters (strijananī), in the eleventh (cf. the tenth, twelfth or fifteenth years respectively, Trik.III. 84a-5). He adds, however, that a disagreeable wife (apriyavādinī) should be superseded at once (cf. Trik.III.85b). The Smṛticandrikā puts the question in its religious perspective. Rejecting the views of Āp.II.5.11.12–13, Devannabhatta quotes another smṛti'. If a wife is barren or produces only daughters, if she is past menstruation (vigatārtavā), diseased (vyādhitā) or insane (unmattā), then she may be abandoned. But if she is innocent of any serious crime (adustă; glossed by Kull. on Manu VIII.388 as atipātakādidoṣarahita), then she should be abandoned only in sexual terms (tīrthatah; glossed by Dev. as yonitaḥ) and not in matters of religion (na tu dharmatah; Sm.C.II. p.439-40). The institution of polygamy may therefore continue without endangering the apparently monoga- mous requirements of religious ritual. 
Tryambaka's assumption here that polygamy is the norm rein- forces my earlier suggestion that his treatise was intended primarily for a prosperous kṣatriya court (see pp.19-20). Certainly, the custom is unknown among the brahmin ritualists of the Apastamba tradition in Tamil Nadu both today and in the recent past (Smith 1984:133-4). It is interesting, therefore, that Tryambaka does not discuss the important question of whether the kṣatriya may sacrifice at all. For it is by no means obvious that he may. 
Ap.śr.VI.15.10, for example, declares that a priest may not perform the agnihotra sacrifice for a kṣatriya (na räjanyasya juhuyāt). Instead, the latter should send food to a brahmin at the time of the sacrifice (or before he himself has eaten; mukhataḥ, Hir.śr.III.7.19, p.357; cf. Dumont 1939:88) to symbolise the ritual (Āp.śr.VI.15. 11). However, if a kṣatriya performs the soma sacrifice and speaks the truth (yo va somayājī satyavādî), then the priest may perform the agnihotra for him (Ap.śr. VI. 15.13; Hir.śr.III.7.19,p.357). Man.śr.I.6.1.54 explains that the agnihotra sacrifice may be per- formed for a kṣatriya if he observes religious law (dhārmukasya); if not, it should be performed only on new- and full-moon days (parvasv itarasya); either way, the kṣatriya should send food to a brahmin daily to represent the sacrifice. 
This exclusion of the kṣatriya is predictable. According to the Käthakasamhita, there is no agnihotra for the kṣatriya because he ignores religious observances and takes life (avratyo hi sa hanti; Kath.Sam. VI.6,p.56). The reasons given by the Maitrāyaṇīsamhitā

123 
are that the kṣatriya is engaged in impure actions (ayajñiyam amedhyam carati), eats food which should not be eaten (aty- anannam), and defeats the brahmin (jināti brāhmaṇam; Mait.I.8.7. p. 126). On new- and full-moon days, however, he keeps his obser- vances and thus may perform the agnihotra. On the other days, he should give food to a brahmin. For the brahmin is Agni: what is eaten by the brahmin is sacrificed to Agni (Kath.Sam. VI.6.p.56). Bodewitz discusses this idea of the brahmin as the recipient of the sacrificial offering (1973:223, note 14). I shall consider the impor- tance of the atitihipüjā for the kṣatriya householder in section IIC, pp. 183-210. For the moment, we need only note two apparently contradictory points. First, Tryambaka assumes the practice of poly- gamy, a custom normally associated with kṣatriyas, thereby imply- ing a predominantly kṣatriya court. Secondly, he advocates the twice-daily agnihotra sacrifice without qualification or proviso regarding the kṣatriya lifestyle. 
Problems relating to polygamy and sacrificial ritual date back a long way. The pūrvamīmāmsakas, for example, discuss whether or not the term patnî should be given in the dual or plural to coincide with the actual number of the sacrificer's wives. As Sabara explains on Jai.IX.3.20, a text used in new- and full-moon sacrifices instructs one to ‘attire the wife' (patnīm sannahya). If the sacrificer has more than one wife, should he employ the modification (üha) of number in order to make the singular reference dual or plural? Jaimini rules that there should be no modification (avikāraḥ; Jai.IX.3.20). Śabara explains that the term patnī is used merely to indicate the sacrificer's assistant and is not intended as a reference to the number of his wives (na cătra dvitvam bahutvam vā vivakṣyate). Even in the case of a modified sacrifice in which more than one wife participates, there should be no modification of the text (Jai.IX.3.21 and Sab.). Thus, however many wives an individual man may have, for the purpose of religious ritual the sacrificer has only one patnī. 
I have already discussed the views of Jaimini and Panini regarding the definition of patnī (section IIB, pp.107–15). Only the wife who shares in the sacrifice and its rewards with her husband may be called patni. All other wives are merely jāyā ('one who gives birth') or bhāryā (‘one who is to be supported or maintained', presumably because she bears children). In fact, throughout his treatise on the religious duties of women, Tryambaka adheres to Panini's rule, using the word patnī only in connection with the sacrifice. For, in 
 
124 
Strīdharmapaddhati 
the context of a largely polygamous court society, it is too limiting a term. He usually prefers the most general terms such as strī, nārī and yoșit, words which do not distinguish between 'woman' and 'wife' (but which in the context of Tryambaka's approach can only mean the latter; see section III). Words denoting an unmarried woman (e.g. kanya, 'daughter', 'unmarried girl') appear rarely, as in the description of Parvati as 'daughter of the Himalayas' (section I, p. 30, note 2). Words carrying associations of chastity (e.g. satī), devotion (e.g. pativrata) and the 'good fortune' associated with marriage (e.g. sumangalī, saubhāgyavatī) are more common; as are those denoting the negative aspects of the 'unwifely' woman (e.g. pumścalī, ‘one who runs after men', a loose woman; cf. sec- tion III, p. 248, note 9). In the context of the fire ritual, however, Tryambaka is concerned not so much with definition as with the practical problems of a polygamous household. For detailed rules are laid down regarding precedence among wives. 
Tryambaka explains. 'If a man has many wives, the worship of fire should be performed only by the senior wife.'13 
Jyestha (lit. 'first, 'best', 'eldest') means the wife that a man marries first (jyestha prathamoḍha; Medh. on Manu IX.122). In discussions concerning the precedence of either the wives themselves or of their sons (e.g. in matters of inheritance), the first or senior wife is usually contrasted with any subsequent or junior wife (paścād uḍhā kaniṣṭhā; Medh. on Manu IX.122). The reason is clear. The wife who is married first participates in the kindling of the sacred fires. She thus becomes associated with the religious rites celebrated in them (Ap.II.11.14; Sm.C.II.p.438). A wife who is married subsequently, once the sacred fires are already established, is therefore deemed a 'second (dvitīyā; Sm.C.II.p. 439, Viṣṇu) or 'junior' (kaniṣṭhā) wife. The first wife is thus the legitimate one, married with full ceremony, and both intended and required to participate in her husband's religious obligations (prathamā dharmapatnī syād; Sm.C.II.p.439, Katy.; cf. Trik. III.93). She is usually of the same varna as her husband (cf. Manu III.12). His religious duty fulfilled, a man may then remarry for more personal reasons such as sexual pleasure (dvitīyā rativardhinī; Sm.C.II.p.439, Käty.). Katyāyana adds that the rewards of any subsequent union 
13. agniśuśrūsanam bahubhāryasya jyesthayaiva kartavyam // Sdhp.8r. 5-6. Cf. Vis.Sm.26.1. 
 
At Dawn 
125 
are 'seen' or obvious (drstam eva phalam); but, unlike the first marriage, such a union produces no 'unseen' or otherworldly effect (nādṛṣṭam upapadyate; Sm.C.II.p.439, Käty.). According to one of the three views put forward by the Trikāṇḍamandana, a wife married for pleasure has no entitlement (adhikāra) to the sacrifice (Trik.I.44b, see above). It follows that junior wives need not be of the same varna as their husband. 
It is evidently assumed that the first wife will be of the same varṇa as her husband. If this is not the case, however, the term jyestha cannot be applied to the wife married first. For varna is more important than timing (cf. section IIC, pp. 165–6, note 12.) As Manu IX.85 explains, if twice-born men marry women of different varṇas, then seniority (jyaisthyam), honour (püjā) and living quarters (vesman) should be allocated according to varna (tāsām varṇakramena). The jyeṣṭhā is thus the first wife of the same varna as her husband. For only that wife is entitled to attend to her husband's personal needs (sarīrasuśruṣām) and to participate in the daily religious rituals (dharmakaryam va naityakam; Manu IX.86). If a man has several wives of the same varna, then he should offer sacrifice with the 'eldest' among them, that is, with the one he married first (jyeṣthayā saha; Vis. Sm.26.1). However, if he has several wives of different varnas, he should offer sacrifice with one of the same varna as himself, even if she is the 'youngest' or most recently married wife of all (kaniṣṭhayāpi; Viṣ.Sm.26.2). 
Tryambaka continues. According to Yajnavalkya, 'if a man has a wife of the same varna (as himself), then he should not ask any other (wife not of the same varna) to perform this religious duty. If he has several wives of the same varna (as himself), then no-one except the senior wife (should be appointed) in religious rites.'14 
Several possibilities are hinted at here. Ideally, the patni is of the same varna as the sacrificer. Thus anyone who foolishly (mohāt) appoints a wife of a lower varṇa to perform the joint sacrifice when the wife of equal varna is alive is held in the same contempt as a cāndāla (Manu IX.87 and Ragh.); or as a brahmin-killer (Sm.C.II. p.438, Katy.); and his acts will bear no fruit (Sm.C.II.p.439, Visnu). If he has more than one wife of the same varṇa, then he should appoint the most senior among them (jyesthaiva sahadharma-

cărinī; Apar. on Yajñ.I.88). The implication-spelled out by Viş.Sm.26.3-is that if there is no wife of the same varṇa (samāna- varṇāyā abhāve), then he should appoint as patnī a wife from the next varna (anantarayaiwa). Nandapandita explains that a brahmin may appoint a kṣatriya wife, a kṣatriya may appoint a vaisya wife. This ruling also holds in times of difficulty (apadi ca; glossed by Nand. to mean 'if the wife of the same varna has not returned in time or if a serious accident has befallen her'). 
But on no account may a südra wife play the part of patnī (Viṣ.Sm. 26.4; Manu III.14). For a woman of ‘the black varna' (kṛṣṇavarṇā yā rāmā)—that is, a sudra woman-is intended for sexual pleasure (ramaṇāyaiva) and not for religious ritual (Vas.XVIII,18; Apar. on Yäjä.1.88; Sm.C.II.p.437; Par.M.I.ii.p.116). I have already noted that the wife of a südra has no right to the title or office of patni because her husband is not entitled to offer sacrifice (see section II B, p. 110). In the case cited here, however, the right of the twice-born husband is not at issue. Yet the sudra wife still may not act as patnī. Indeed, the gods and ancestors will not accept any offering in which she has taken part (Manu III.18). For the dharma- patnī must be without fault (nirdoșă; Sm.C.II.p.438, Dakṣa); and the sūdra woman is demonstrably (i.e by virtue of her birth) at fault. So degraded is she, that she will demote the brahmin who marries her to her own level of sūdra (Manu III.15–19). We must conclude, therefore, that—at least in the context of religious ritual, and with reference to the sudra woman alone—the widespread idea (noted in section I) that the varṇa of a wife is defined by that of her husband 'just as a river merges with the sea' no longer applies. 
Conversely, if the jyestha is at fault (doșe satī; Sm.C.II.p.438, Daksa), she can no longer be the dharmapatni: she must be replaced. Tryambaka explains. ‘If the jyeṣṭhā is at fault, then (the ritual duty) must be performed by a junior wife.'15 He quotes Katyāyana to the same effect. 'If a man has many wives, then such rituals as the agnihotra should be performed with a wife of the same varna as him- self; if there are many of the same varna, then with the senior wife as long as she is not at fault.'16

Two points may be made here. First, it is unclear when a wife is sufficiently 'at fault' to be disqualified from taking part in the joint sacrifice. We have already established that she may be rejected sexually for any number of reasons ranging from barrenness and disease to insanity, but none of these bar her from the joint sacrifice (Sm.C.II.p.440). The implication is that only a serious crime (atipātakādidoṣa; Kull. on Manu VIII.388) can do that. The Trikändamandana suggests infidelity and hostility to one's husband (vyabhicāravatī . dveşini drohiņi; Trik.I.79c); alternatively, sexual intercourse with his student or teacher, or (deliberately) aborting a foetus (śisyagām gurugām garbhahantrim; Trik.III.89). Secondly, the replacement should ideally be of the same varṇa as the husband. Neither Tryambaka nor Katyāyana suggests that even an unsuitable jyesthä may be replaced by a wife of a lower varna. However, an atipātaka crime must constitute a time of distress or difficulty (apadi; cf. Viş.Sm.26.3). Under these circum- stances, the replacement may be of the next varna down. 
If there are several junior wives of the same varna, however, how should the choice be made? According to Tryambaka, 'when there are several junior wives, (the religious ritual) should be performed by one who is the mother of sons (lit. "heroes"). If several junior wives have borne sons, then it should be performed by one who is obedient to (her husband's) command, full of good qualities, and solicitous (dakṣa; lit. "skilful", "clever", "industrious").'17 In support of the latter ruling, Tryambaka quotes Kātyāyana. ‘From among those of his wives who have given birth to sons, he should appoint one who is obedient to (his) command, solicitous, gentle- voiced and pure (in character).'18

However, Tryambaka continues: 'if that (wife who has been appointed) is unable to perform the various services (suśrūṣādi) (required of her) every day, then each (wife) should do them in turn day by day in order of seniority. (Alternatively,) if the one (who has been appointed for that day) is unable (to take care of everything required of her) within the one day, then all the wives should take part: they should divide the work (between them), each according to her (particular) knowledge (or expertise).'19 As evidence for these rulings, Tryambaka quotes Kātyāyana's considerably abbreviated version of the same ideas. ‘If (one wife) is unable (to do everything every day), then (they should all take it) in turn; according to the (nature of the) work and in order of seniority. If (one wife) is un- able (to do everything within one day), then they should (all) do (it) at once, dividing (the work between them) according to their expertise. '20 
It seems that Tryambaka is now suggesting that all the wives of the sacrificer may assist their husband in the joint ritual. This is certainly one of the three views mentioned in Trik.I.43-4. Given Tryambaka's previous rulings, however, it seems an unlikely conclusion for him to reach. I suggest that he is no longer discussing which wife should assist her husband in the joint sacrifice. Instead, the general term suśruṣādi probably covers all the duties that might come under the heading of stridharma, whether religious or domestic (see section V, pp. 312-13). In this more general sense, then, the wives in a polygamous household should share the avail- able work between them in accordance with both their individual talents and the accepted rules of precedence. In fact, the rule is vague enough to allow for almost any eventuality. (For a vivid autobiographical account by a co-wife of life in a joint family today, see Bennett 1983:187-200.)

At which point should the wife participate? 
129 
According to Tryambaka, the ritual ‘adorning of the fire' (agnya- lankaraṇam)—which he has already established as the wife's part in the ceremony (section IIB, pp. 107–15)—should be per- formed immediately after such activities as sweeping round (the fires; parisamūhanādy).”21 His evidence for this is a quotation attributed to Baudhāyana. "The (learned) teachers declare that one should always (i.e. when oblations are offered) sweep around (the fires), sprinkle water around (them), strew darbha grass around (them), pour water around (them), put fuel on (them), and (then) adorn (the hearth).'22 
These are all preliminary rituals to be performed after the fires have been lit (uddharanam; see below) and before the central ritual of offering cow's milk into the fire. Parisamühana is the ritual of wiping with a wet hand three times around each of the three fires in turn, moving from the north-east to the north and keeping one's right side towards the fire, while reciting mantras (Śānkh.gṛ.I.7.11; Aśv.gr.1.3.1. and comm.). According to some, it is performed either before or after the agnihotra offering; according to others, it is performed both before and after it (Āp.śr.VI.3.1-3; Hir.śr.III.7. 16, p.341). Tryambaka evidently assumes it should be done before- hand. Paryukṣaṇa is the ritual sprinkling of water with mantras around each of the fires, again going from north-east to north (Āśv.śr.II.2.11–13 and comm.; Man.śr.I.6.1.10). Paristarana is the ritual scattering of darbha grass round the fires as in the darsa- pūrṇamāsa sacrifice; that is, so that the grasses to the east and west point north, and those to the north and south point east (Katy.śr.IV. 13.15 and comm.; Āp.śr.VI.3.5; Hir.śr.III.7.16, p.341; Mān.śr.I. 6.1.11). Parişecana is the ritual pouring of water around the fires (Ap.śr. VI.5.4, Rudradatta comm.). Upasamādhāna is the act of placing fuel on the fires to ensure that they are burning properly. In Baudhāyana's list of preliminary ritual acts, that of adorning the hearth comes after these. 
It is clear, even from this brief quotation,, that Tryambaka's

emphasis is quite different from that of Baudhāyana. The latter merely lists the various actions leading up to the offering of milk, without indicating which should be performed by whom. Try- ambaka, having defined the wife's participation in the ritual as alankara, uses Baudhāyana's quotation to demonstrate when she should play her part. 
According to some, however, all that is required of the patnī is her presence. Katy.śr.IV.13.13, quoted above (section IIB, p. 121), explains that the patni enters the sacrificial enclosure and takes her place in the vihara in the same way as her husband does. But the paddhati on the commentary remarks that, according to oral tradition (sampradaya), the patnī does nothing else beyond taking her seat (upavesanavyatiriktam patnī kim api na karoti; Weber edn., p. 404). Now even the act of decorating the hearth is denied her. Moreover, as Tryambaka turns his attention to the issue of when the patni should take her seat, he too seems to have accepted this even more restrictive definition of her role. For there is in fact no further reference to her participation in the ritual. 
Tryambaka continues. 'Apastamba declares that the patnī should take her seat in her own place immediately after the ritual of milking.'23 The quotation reads as follows. "The agnihotra should be performed by a man together with his wife; the wife should take her seat in her own place. 24 'However, Baudhāyana maintains that the wife should take her seat immediately after the fire has been taken (from the gārhapatya fire to light the other two fires).'25 The quota- tion for this statement reads: 'the patni should be present at the evening and the morning (sacrifice).”26 
The patni's 'own place' (svāyatana) is the seat assigned to her for the duration of the ritual, to the south-west of the garhapatya fire (Āp.śr.II.5.2; Baudh.I.7.15.26; Sen 1982: plan 4). 
The ritual of milking (dohana) is described in some detail in the srautasūtras. According to some, the agnihotra cow may not be

milked by a sudra (Kāty.śr.IV.14.1); according to others, it may (Āp.śr.VI.3.11–14). According to some, the cow should be ac- companied by a male calf (pumvatsa; Kāty.śr.IV.14.1); according to others, the calf may be female (strīvatsa; Šāṁkh.śr.II.8.6–7). The cow is placed to the south of the ähavaniya enclosure with its head facing north, north-east or east. The calf is brought to it, then taken away. Finally, the cow is milked. A special earthenware vessel (agnihotrasthālī; defined Āp.śr.VI.3.7 and comm.) is used to collect the milk (Kāty.śr.IV.14.1 and comm.; Ap.śr.VI.3.15). 
Uddharanam is the ritual lighting of the ahavaniya fire with a brand or coals taken from the garhapatya (gārhapatyād āhavanī- yasyoddharaṇam; Kāty.śr.IV.13.2). It is performed by the priest and is the first of the series of rituals that form the agnihotra sacrifice. Soon afterwards, the sacrificer takes his place (Kāty.śr.IV.13.12). The patni enters the vihara at the same juncture and along the same path (Kāty.śr.IV.13.13). According to the Baudhāyanaśrautasūtra, before the cow is milked, the priest should enflame the garhapatya fire, transport the flame to the āhavanīya, and arrange the sacri- ficial utensils (Baudh.śr.III.4.1-6). In this text, however, there is no clear instruction concerning when the patni should take her place. The sutra quoted by Tryambaka (Baudh.śr.III.4.8; see note 26) merely makes the general statement that her presence is required at the sacrifice. Moreover, Tryambaka fails to mention the following sūtra which seriously undermines this ruling: that is, according to some, she need only attend the evening sacrifice (sāyamsāyam ity eke; Baudh.śr.III.4.9), and not the morning one at all. However, he does quote it in his section on evening rituals (see section IID, note 2). Mān.śr.I.6.2.16 agrees (sāyam patny anväste na prātaḥ). In the Apastambasrautasutra, on the other hand, the instructions referring to the patnī are given after both the uddharana and dohana rituals have been described (Ap.śr. VI.5.1-2) Sdhp.8v.8-9, note 24). But this is not exclusive to the patnī. For in Āp.śr.V1.5.3, we read that the sacrificer too must make his way to his seat in the prescribed way. Thus both sacrificer and wife are present for the crucial homa ritual. 
Tryambaka concludes. 'The important thing is that both (hus- band and wife) should be present for the homa offering.'27 
27. home tübhayoh sannidhanam mukham // Sdhp.8v.10. 
132 
Stridharmapaddhati 
How important is the presence of either husband or wife? 
Tryambaka begins with the question of the husband's absence. 'If the sacrificer is not present then his wife certainly should be.'28 He quotes Katyāyana. 'If both husband and wife are absent, the sacrifice may not be performed by a priest. For when both (husband and wife) are absent, the offering is worthless. '29 'But if a brahmin has business to take care of, he may assign (the responsibility of) the fire to his wife, appoint a priest (to conduct the ritual), and then leave home. But he should not stay away for long unnecessarily.'30 
The first point to notice here is that the religious obligation to perform the daily agnihotra ritual does not require a man to stay at home all the time. Indeed, the absence of the householder was a common enough occurrence for rulings to be made about it. This becomes particularly obvious when we realize what is meant by 'leaving home'. Trik.III.62-4 and 66 define it variously as going to the outskirts of the village (gramāntam), going beyond the village boundary (sīmāntam), crossing a river that flows directly into the sea (nadim ambudhigāminīm), and so on. Such constricting defini- tions make it necessary for the husband to be allowed to 'leave home'. The resulting rulings lay down what constitutes a good reason for going; and what precautions he should take. Manu IX. 74, for example, declares that a man who has business to attend to (kāryavān) away from home should see to the maintenance of his wife while he is away; for even a virtuous woman is corrupted when distressed for the lack of it (avṛttikarṣitā). A man might journey abroad for any number of reasons related to his individual fulfilment (puruṣārtha, Medh.; as opposed to reasons relating to the sacrifice, kratvartha).

(dharmakaryārtham); to acquire learning (vidyartham); to gain fame or ensure a good reputation (yaso 'rtham); and for the sake of pleasure (kāmārtham; glossed by Kull. as bhāryantaropabhogartham, 'to enjoy the favours of another woman', or perhaps ‘another wife'). Manu's concern is to lay down rules for how long a woman should wait for her husband to return. Tryambaka, in his section on the duties of the wife whose husband is away, explains how such a woman should dress and behave (see p. 291). Here, however, he is concerned with the arrangements that a man must make regarding the daily fire ritual if he has to go away. 
Tryambaka's emphasis is quite different from Manu's. While the latter decrees that a deserted wife should wait for her husband for three, six or eight years (Manu IX.76), Tryambaka insists that he should not stay away long without good reason. While Manu and his commentators list the reasons a man might have to go away, Tryambaka rules that the only acceptable reason for such a journey is to earn money in order to pay the costs of the daily fire sacrifice. Moreover, the freedom to leave home to earn this money applies only to the man, never to his wife. 
Tryambaka explains. "This injunction regarding leaving home is acceptable (only) for the purpose of earning money and only in relation to a man. In the case of the wife (patnī), since she does not (or is not expected to) earn money, she need not leave home.'31 Tryambaka uses the word patni here to suit the context of the wife who participates in the joint sacrifice. The ruling itself, however, would clearly apply to any wife. Tryambaka does not consider the question of the unsupported wife; Manu does. If a man goes away without providing for his wife in his absence, she may earn her own living by 'blameless handicrafts' (śilpair agarhitair; Manu IX.75). Tryambaka, writing from within the sheltered confines of a court, evidently does not envisage the possibility of a wife needing to earn money for herself. But if such a thing were necessary, like Manu, Tryambaka would undoubtedly expect her to earn her living within the home. According to the Trikändamandana, however, a wife may travel abroad as long as either her husband or one of her co-wives is tending the sacred fires (Trik.III.67; cf. III.58,61).

Tryambaka continues with an unattributed quotation taken from the Trikändamandana. 'But (it is otherwise) for a man. It is reason- able for a man who performs the (daily) agnihotra ritual to leave home in order to earn money, because the sacrifice can only take place if there is money (to pay for it). But he should not go away for (other reasons) such as going on a pilgrimage (tīrthādyartham).'32, In fact, 'leaving home for the purpose of going on a pilgrimage is forbidden on account of this ruling that (staying at) home and (attending to) all the duties of the household(er) is the best thing for the man who is entitled to perform sacrificial rituals. Thus the ancient sages forbid the man who is established in the householder stage of life to go (on any pilgrimage) to a sacred place. '33 
Tryambaka's description of the sacrifice that can only take place if there is sufficient money is obviously a reference to the śrauta fires (see pp.103-5). These are established, not at marriage like the aupa- sana fire, but when a man already has a son and is wealthy enough to be able to afford to pay the priests. Vas. VIII.9 explains that a man who has ‘enough (wealth) to set up the (three) fires' (alam agnyadheyāya) should become an agnihotrin. And if he has 'enough' to cover the expenses of a soma sacrifice (alam ca somāya), then he should perform that too (Vas.VIII.10). Alam is glossed by Devannabhatta as samartha: if, that is, he has the 'capacity' or 'means' (Sm.C.II.p.417). With regard to the soma sacrifice, this 'capacity' or 'means' is defined by Manu XI.7 as having enough food to support one's dependants (bhrtyavṛttaye) for three years or more (traivārṣikam bhaktam... adhikam vāpi; cf. Yājñ.I.124; Sm.C.II.p.417-18). With regard to setting up the srauta fires, Devannabhatta explains that a man must be wealthy (dhane sati), not poor (nirdhanaḥ, Prajapati; alpadhanaḥ, Dev.; Sm.C.II. p.420). This is undoubtedly what Tryambaka means when he rules that a man may leave home in order to earn money for the sacrifice. Only if the sacrifice itself is endangered by the lack of money to pay

expenses may the householder (i.e. agnihotrin) relinquish his personal responsibility for it, and that only briefly. 
Unlike Manu IX.76, Tryambaka does not allow the householder to leave home for the sake of glory or amorous adventures. Even the desire to visit sacred places, such as the Ganges or the Himalayas, is unacceptable. Given the history of the Thanjavur Marathas (see Leslie 1983(2):appendix B), this is curious. For every one of their grandfathers, householders by definition, must have left their homes in Maharashtra to seek their fortunes in the south. Some of them may have taken their wives with them at the outset, but most must have travelled alone, perhaps sending for their wives and families later. This is an important point. For these rules apply only to the householder who leaves home alone. If he takes his wife with him, then he should also take the sacred fires. Husband and wife would thus continue to perform the agnihotra together. But if he travels alone, the fires must remain at home under the guardianship of his wife; and in that case, he should only leave home in order to earn money to pay for the sacrifice. Clearly, those engaged in or ac- companying military expeditions a generation or two earlier took little notice of such requirements. They were similarly untroubled by rulings that one's right to sacrifice is destroyed by living in another country, for example, in such barbarous places as Bengal and Kalinga (e.g. Trik.I.164). 
The Smṛticandrikā makes some allowance in this direction. Ac- cording to Paithīnasī, if one's sacrificial duties are interrupted as a result of being harassed by enemies (pīdyamānasya satrubhiḥ), then one is allowed two months' grace (Sm.C.II.p.436). Perhaps by Tryambaka's time, in the uneasy peace of Mughal supervision, such a proviso was no longer necessary. Perhaps by then the rulings of pious brahmins were more firmly reinstated. Or perhaps Tryam- baka merely believed they should be. Alternatively, the ruling that a kṣatriya (and a vaiśya; comm. on Aśv.śr.II.1.3-5) might send food to a brahmin in lieu of the ritual may have been made precisely to allow him more time to attend to his main occupation (see pp. 122–3). 
Tryambaka returns to an earlier statement and quotation con- cerning the patnī (see note 24 above). 'With reference to the wife, however, Āpastamba's ruling that "the agnihotra should be (per- formed) by a man together with his wife" defines the close connection tion (sambandha) of the wife to the sacrifice. She should therefore 
 
136 
Stridharmapaddhati 
never abandon the agnihotra, nor stay elsewhere. '34 
The plural term, āpastambācāryaiḥ (see notes 34, 44) requires some clarification. Its use here, as in most late texts, indicates not several 'teachers' but a single authority deserving of special respect. Initially a custom in modern Indian languages (e.g. Marathi, Guja- rati), especially with named teachers, this honorific plural percolated back into Sanskrit at a fairly late date (LSJ). Since Tryambaka reserves such respect solely for Apastamba, this almost certainly means that he belonged to the Apastambaśākhā of the Kṛṣṇa- yajurveda tradition (cf. p.25; Leslie 1983 (2), appendix C). 
'Staying elsewhere' means away from home and thus away from the agnihotra enclosure and the sacrifice. Tryambaka's point is that there is an essential link between the patnī and the sacrifice; more specifically, between the patni and the sacred fires. I shall return to this point below. For the moment, we need only note that the sacrifice may proceed in the absence of the husband but never in the absence of the wife (cf. Trik.III.57–60; but also Trik.III.61). 
Tryambaka anticipates the objection that the wife should be allowed to go on pilgrimages. It is certainly true that all over India today large numbers of women embark on long pilgrimages, both for their own and for their families' sakes (cf. Morinis 1984:302); and it seems likely that it was always so. (For a statistical analysis of the purposes of pilgrimage in West Bengal today, see Morinis 1984:312–16; for a more general account of pilgrim motivation throughout India, see Bhardwaj 1983:148-62.) But the practice is condemned most emphatically by Tryambaka. 
'According to the scriptures, all the rewards obtained by visiting sacred places are (to be found) in the agnihotra itself. '35 Tryambaka quotes from the Trikändamandana. 'Brahmā, Visņu, Siva, Surya, cows and brahmins, ancestors and gods, ritual observances, places of pilgrimage and austerities; all these are (to be found) in the agnihotra hall.'36 The quotation continues with three lines of

commentary that qualify the claim. 'But we say that not even all the places of pilgrimage (together) can equal the agnihotra. Or, alter- natively, only when a (learned) brahmin has relinquished his right to perform the sacrifice (yajñādhikāre... nivṛtte) may he wander about visiting sacred places. For the great sages who are by nature without sin have declared that the merit (to be found) in (visiting) a sacred place is the reward of the sacrifice.'37 For, as the Trikända- mandana explains elsewhere, all sacred places reside in the altar itself (sarvāni tīrthāni vasanti vedyām), and all deities may be worshipped in the agnihotra ritual; it is therefore pointless (vyartham) to journey abroad in order to worship any one of these (Trik., prakīrṇakānda 27). Interestingly, Morinis' comments on 'the anti-pilgrimage tradition in Hinduism' do not even touch on this orthodox, speci- fically dharmasastric theme of the rejection of pilgrimage on the grounds of the superiority of the agnihotra ritual; presumably because it has little relevance today (1984:74-6). 
The question of going on pilgrimages is raised in two other sections of Tryambaka's treatise. In his rulings on things to be avoided, the practice of going on pilgrimages (tīrthayātra) is in- cluded among the six things that cause women and sudras to fall (strīsūdrapatanāni șat; see section IV, note 7). In the section on general behaviour (see p. 273-4), a lengthy passage attributed to Bṛhaspati's praise of Lopamudra in the Skandapurāṇa includes the following. '(The good wife) should stay well away from festivals and public gatherings. She should not go on pilgrimages and so on, or to such things as weddings or public shows.'38 'If a woman wants to bathe in a sacred place (tīrthasnānārthinī), then she should drink the water used to bathe her husband's feet (patipādodakam). For, in the case of a woman, her own husband is superior to even Sankara (Siva) or Visņu.'39

Stridharmapaddhati 
The latter ruling seems to presuppose a brahmin husband, for the water used to give a ritual (as opposed to a ‘dirt-removing') bath to the feet of brahmins is traditionally considered purifying, on a par with the waters of the Ganges. Similarly, at a traditional initiation ceremony (when it genuinely indicates the beginning of Vedic education), men and (especially) women come to receive the tīrtha or purifying water used to bathe the initiate's feet. Water is cere- monially dropped onto the child's big toe, collected and given as angusthajala. Nowadays, since most brahmin boys go through the ritual before going to ordinary schools, the water has no such purifying properties. Even fifty years ago, however, orthodox women in Maharashtra still drank the angusthajala of their brahmin husbands (LSJ). According to Lynn Bennett, village women in Nepal still do this before every rice meal (1938:174-5; and a striking photograph of a wife washing her husband's feet before drinking the gora pani or 'foot water', p. 175 and cover; see also section IIC, pp. 221–7). 
To return to the Stridharmapaddhati, the parallel rulings for the husband (in this section) and for the wife (section IV, pp. 273-4), are startlingly different. Both are forbidden to go on pilgrimages but, while the man is directed to find the fruits of pilgrimage in the fire sacrifice, his wife should seek them in the water used to bathe her husband's feet. The difference in the religious spheres of husband and wife could not be more graphically stressed. 
Regarding Tryambaka's assertion that a brahmin may indulge in pilgrimages only when he has relinquished his right to perform the sacrifice, this only occurs when he renounces the life of the house- holder to become a forest hermit or an ascetic. As long as he is a householder, therefore, he will gain greater merit by performing the sacrifice than by any other form of worship. This ruling-given in the masculine, and applied by Tryambaka to the patni and thus, by extension, to all women-presupposes the aśrama system. Ac- cording to the ideal classification presented by Manu (i.e. the later samuccaya version), a man should progress from childhood through four temporary stages: Vedic student, householder, forest hermit, and renouncer or ascetic. The artificiality of the system is clear, evidence of the orthodox delight in classification. In fact, as indi- cated above, early formulations of the theory give the four āśramas as alternatives (Gaut.I.3.1-3,35; Baudh.II.6.11.12-16,27). As the ascetic movement grew, however, it became important to 
 
At Dawn 
139 
assimilate the new ideas into the orthodox system. The theory of the four successive stages emerged with renunciation as an integral part at the end of the line (Manu IV.1, VI.33; Olivelle 1974, 1978,1984; cf. section I, pp. 44-5. 
But none of this applies to women (cf. Leslie 1980:46ff.; 1983(1): 99 ff.). In all dharmasastra texts, women are dealt with outside the framework of asrama. We have already seen how they were gradual- ly excluded from Vedic studentship (see section I). For men, the third āśrama soon became obsolete (cf. Olivelle 1978:32). For women, it had only ever been a continuation of married life. For, as Manu explains, a man embarking on this stage may either commit his wife to his sons' keeping (putreṣu... nikṣipya) or take her with him (VI.3). For her, it is simply another form of wifely obedience, not a voluntary renunciation on her own behalf. The fourth asrama was theoretically barred to women as it was to sūdras (cf. Olivelle 1984:113-15). For, according to the rules of dharmaśāstra, only those who had embarked on the first stage of Vedic education could graduate to the fourth. Women were excluded on social grounds too. For renunciation implies independence from family and social control whereas women were seen to be always dependent (Manu V.147-9; Vas. V.1-2; cf. section IV, p. 276, note 9). Apart from women's lack of freedom, the concept of 'female ascetic' is itself an anomaly. For women are so identified with both family life and sexual pleasure that the idea of a woman renouncing these things is (from the orthodox male point of view) a contradiction in terms. Nonetheless, the renunciation of women was a common enough occurrence for there to be frequent rulings against it (e.g. Manu VIII. 363; Yājñ.II.293; Vis.Sm.XXV.12). Tryambaka even includes the female ascetic (pravrajită, śramaṇā) among the types of women the virtuous wife should strive to avoid (see pp. 170-2). 
In the realm of dharmasastra, however, a woman may never renounce the household life of her own volition, either to go into the forest as a hermit or to pursue the ascetic life. From the man's point of view, she is the household. Separation from it comes only with death-her own or her husband's-or with disgrace. Only as a widow (cf. Vas. 19.29,33-4) or an abandoned woman may she wander from place to place. As a respectable wife, certainly as the privileged patnī, she should remain with the sacred fires at home. 
Tryambaka returns to the quotation already given above (see note 29) and attributed there to Katyayana. 'When both (husband 
 
140 
Strīdharmapaddhati 
and wife) are absent, the offering is worthless.' According to Tryam- baka, 'the ruling concerning the close connection between the patnī (and the sacred fires of the agnihotra) is equally applicable to the aupāsana ritual since Katyāyana's statement given above is common (to both).'40 
The question of Tryambaka's relative interest in and distinction between the śrauta and grhya rituals is discussed above (see pp. 103- 5). More important, what is the special relationship between the patni and the sacred fire or fires? According to Apastamba, the wife who is present at the kindling of the fires (ādhāne hi satī) becomes linked with the sacrificial rituals performed with them (karmabhiḥ sambadhyate; Ap.II.5.11.14; cf. Sm.C.II.p.438). But what effect does this special link have? 
The Smrticandrika discusses the issue at length. According to śruti, those who kindle the sacred fires are cremated with them (āhitāgnibhir dahanti; Sm.C.II.p.441). In theory, this applies to both sacrificer and wife. As Apastamba explains, whoever dies first is cremated with the three srauta fires of the agnihotra; whoever dies second is cremated with the single aupāsana fire (Sm.C.II.p.443). In fact, however, if the patnī dies first, the sacrificer may either promote an existing second wife or remarry, rekindling the fires for his second patnī (punah parinīya tayā sahādhānam; Sm.C.II.p.441). According to Yajñ.I.89, he should do so without delay (avilam- bayan; sighrain eva, Mit.). For a man should not remain for even a day without an āśrama (anāśrami ... kṣaṇam ekam api, Dakṣa I.10; dinam ekam api, Mit. on Yajñ.I.89). A widower can, of course, become a renouncer (Baudh.II.10.17.4) but the house- holder's life is always preferred. In dharmasastra, there is the constant suggestion that only those unable to be householders (such as the crippled or impotent) should 'renounce' the house- holder way (cf. Olivelle 1984:34). But before the widower may resume the householder's sacrificial duties, his patnī and the sacred fires associated with her must be burned up together, and replaced. It follows that a junior wife may never be cremated with the sacred fires while the patnī is still alive (Sm.C.II.p.440, Visnu; Mit. on Yājñ.1.89).

141 
This link between the sacred fires and the patnī is not indissoluble. Yājñ.1.89 specifies that the wife cremated in this way should be well- behaved (vṛttavatī; glossed by Dev. and Mit. as ācāravati). Kātyā- yana spells out the proviso. The patni may only be cremated with the sacred fires if she has fulfilled her religious obligations and be- haved virtuously (dharmacārini sadhvi). If she has been difficult (viparītā), then she should not be cremated in this way; and the husband should remarry anyway (Sm.C.II.p.441, Katy.). In fact, as the Trikändamandana demonstrates, there were several views on this issue of when to reset the fires. According to Trik.III. 92, for example, a junior wife may not be cremated with the śrauta fires. According to Trik.III.94, any wife 'without distinction' (strīmātram aviseṣena) may be cremated with the śrauta fires. According to Trik.III.100-1, because of the primary importance (pradhānatvāt) of the husband and the obvious secondary impor- tance (sākṣād angatvät; comm.) of the wife, her death has no effect at all (cf. comm. on Trik.II.8). 
According to the general consensus of opinion, however, if the patni is virtuous, she becomes identified with the sacred fires for the rest of her married life. So great is the identification that her presence at the sacrifice is more important than her husband's. Moreover, the fires and the ritual die with her, albeit temporarily. The widower is faced with three options. He may renounce the householder life. He may (as discussed briefly above, see pp.114- 15) rekindle the fires for himself alone (e.g. Trik.III.128), or with a 'substitute wife' made of kusa grass. Or, as most writers on dharmasastra prefer, he should rekindle the fires with a new patnī, thus symbolising the ritual beginning of a new life. The alternatives open to the widow on her husband's death are strikingly different. She may not rekindle the fires for herself alone, nor make a 'substitute husband' for ritual purposes; nor may she rekindle the fires with a new husband and embark upon a new ritual life. Instead, she should either die with her husband (sahagamana; see section IV, pp. 291–8), or live out her days in ascetic and celibate widowhood (vidhavādharma; see section IV, pp. 298-304). For only in her hus- band's lifetime is her ritual (and social) status assured. 
Is the patni the ritual agent of the sacrifice? 
Given the identification of the patni with the sacred fires, and the 
142 
Stridharmapaddhati 
importance of her presence at the sacrifice, should she be con- sidered the performer of the sacrifice? May she officiate in her husband's absence? According to Tryambaka, she may not. 
He discusses the śrauta ritual (agnihotrahome) first, beginning with two quotations attributed respectively to śruti and sūtra litera- ture. They read as follows. First, 'therefore the sacrificial ritual of agnihotra involves one priest.'41 Secondly, 'he (the sacrificer) should perform the sacrifice himself on parvan days, and at other times one of the priests should do it.'42 As a result of these two rulings, as Tryambaka points out, 'in the case of the agnihotra oblation, there can be no assumption that the patnī is the agent (of the sacrifice) since the priest and the sacrificer are so defined.'43 
The parvan days are the 'junctures' of the month, the especially sacred times of the new and full moon (amāvāsyā and pūrṇimā; cf. comm. on Aśv.śr.II.4.2). The phrase 'one of the priests' (rtvijām eka[ḥ]) is a reference to the general rule that sacrificial rituals (yajñakratu) normally require four priests. Even soma sacrifices involving sixteen priests have four main ones with three assistants each (Āśv.śr.IV.1.6; Āp.śr.X.1.8-9). In the agnyädheya, darśa- pūrṇamāsa and other istis, only four are necessary: adhvaryu, āgnīdhra, hotṛ, and brahman; and all are given the general name of rtvij. Of these, only the adhvaryu is required for the agnihotra ritual. 
The word yajamāna is assumed without comment to denote the male sacrificer alone. Both the early acceptance of a 'sacrificing married couple' (vajamānadampatyoḥ; Say. on R.V.VIII.31.5) and the much-debated question of the modification (ūha) of gender (see section I, pp. 39-43) are long forgotten. 
Tryambaka next considers the aupāsana ritual. His evidence is a quotation from Āpastamba, again accorded the plural of respect (see pp. 135-6, note 34). ‘An offering is scorned (by the gods) if it is performed by a woman or an uninitiated person (anupetena), or if it is mixed with alkaline (kṣāra) or saline (lavaṇa) substances or with inferior food (avarānna).' Tryambaka concludes that, ac-

cording to this statement, ‘in the aupāsana oblation too, the agency of the patni is prohibited.'44 
The term upeta means literally 'one who has entered into or approached'; as in (a)vyañjanopeta, ‘a girl who has (or has not yet) reached puberty'. On its own, and in the context of dharmaśāstra, it invariably means 'one who has approached a teacher for initiation'. Strictly speaking, the term denotes a boy who has begun his studies but not yet completed them. For example, the rulings on food in the Apastambadharmasutra include the statement that an upeta should not eat the leftovers (ucchista; see section IIC, pp. 221-7) of women or an anupeta (Āp.II.4.9.7). The Ujjvalā glosses the former term as 'one who has undergone the initiation ceremony but who has not yet (completed his studies and) returned home' (kṛtopanayano 'samā- vṛttaḥ; Ujj. on Āp.II.4.9.7); that is, the brahmacarin. Since this is so (evam sati), the commentary continues, then one who has completed his studies and returned home (the snataka) incurs no such sin (samāvṛttasyocchiṣṭam bhuñjānasya na doṣaḥ syat; Ujj. on Āp.II. 4.9.7, Benares edn.). The distinction is an interesting one, as we shall see in Tryambaka's section on food (section IIC, pp. 210-33), and in particular, in the subsection concerning the wife's own meal (pp. 221-7). A similar distinction is implied in the Aśvalayanagṛhya- sūtra. After a series of rulings relating to the Vedic student, Áśv. gr. 1.23.21 explains that they apply to a boy who has not been initiated before (ity anupetapūrvasya). The subsequent rules apply to one who has been initiated before (athopetapurvasya; Aśv.gr.1.23.22). Nārāyaṇa does not comment on either term, but it is clear that a person who has completed his Vedic studentship would not return to the teacher a second time: the term must there- fore denote a drop-out from traditional Vedic education; that is, one who has been initiated but has failed to complete his studies as required. 
More frequently, however, the term is used as a synonym for upanīta (‘an initiated person'; cf. upetaḥ, Yājñ.III.2, upanītaḥ, Mit.; Karkopādhyāya, Jayarama, Harihara etc. on Par.gr.III.10.10) or upavīta (‘one invested with the sacred thread'); and the comple-

tion of Vedic studies is assumed. In its more common negative form (anupeta; glossed by Sudarsana on Ap.gr.III.8.3 as anupanīta, Benares edn.), it denotes either an adult male who is theoretically of the first three varnas but has never in fact been initiated; or a male child, born to parents of the first three varnas, who has not yet been initiated but will be. The first meaning is exemplified by Ap.I.1.1.32 which rules that if a man's father and grandfather were never initiated (yasya pitä pitämaha ity anupetau), then both he and they are deemed to be 'brahmin-killers' (syātām te brahmahasamstutāḥ). Consequently, before such a person may be taught the Veda (Āp.I.1.2.4), he must recite certain mantras daily for a whole year for each uninitiated ancestor (pratipūruṣam samkhyāya samvat- saran yāvanto 'nupetah syuh; Ap.I.1.2.1). In its original context, Tryambaka's quotation (Āp.gr.III.8.10.3; cf. the parallel rulings in Ap.II.6.15.14-15, 17-18) may be interpreted in either way. The issue is what renders a sacrifice invalid and, in particular, whether a woman or an uninitiated man (or boy) may officiate. The answer, for Apastamba as for Tryambaka, is that they may not (striyānu- petena ... homam paricakṣate, Āp.gr. III.8.10.3; na strī juhuyāt| nānupetaḥ, Āp.II.6.15.17-18; cf. Manu II.171). It is clear from the context of Tryambaka's treatise that the ruling is given to counter- act the suggestion that, if a man is unable to perform the ritual, his wife or young son may do it for him (see below for a further dis- cussion of temporary substitutes). 
Dharmasastra literature defines kṣāralavaṇa in a number of ways. The issue is usually raised either (as here) in relation to which foods may not be offered in a sacrifice (e.g. Ap.gr.III.8.3; Āp.II. 6.15.14); or in relation to which foods may not be eaten by indi- viduals in special categories, such as the (celibate) Vedic student (e.g. Āśv.gr.1.22.17; Āp.I.1.2.23; Hir.gr.1.8.2, but cf. v.9), the newly married (and therefore celibate) couple (e.g. Āśv.gṛ.1.8.10), or those engaged in the ritual period of mourning (and celibacy; e.g. Manu V.73). Kṣāra means literally 'sharp' or 'pungent'. It is defined by Haradatta as that which makes one's saliva flow (lälotpadyate; Ujj. on Ap.II.6.15.14). According to Nārāyaṇa's ⚫commentary on Aśv.gr.1.8.10, however, the term denotes certain types of pulse. For Mātṛdatta on Hir.gr.I.8.2 (p.108), it is molasses (guḍādir ikṣuvikāraḥ). For Sarvajñanārāyaṇa on Manu V.73, it is an alkaline substance (sarjikādi; carbonate of soda, Dutt 1922: 
 
At Dawn 
145 
88). For Medhätithi on Manu V.73 and the Mitäkṣarā on Yājñ. III.36, it is made from barley (yavakṣārādi; carbonate of potash, Dutt 1922:87). Kullūka on Manu V.73 takes kṣāralavana together as a karmadhāraya compound meaning ‘manufactured (as opposed to natural) salt' (kṛtrimalavana). In the context of ayurveda, Suśruta distinguishes five categories of kṣāra including yavakṣāra and sarjikākṣāra mentioned above (Meulenbeld 1974:459; Dutt 1922: 21-2, 81-2, 87-8). Ayurveda also distinguishes several kinds of lavana including rock salt (saindhava; Medh. on Manu V.73) and sun-dried sea salt (sāmudra; Meulenbeld 1974:495–6). 
The term avaränna (‘inferior food') denotes food made from pulses or split peas (kośīdhānyāni māṣādīni kṛṣṇadhānyāni... etc.; Har. on Ap.gr., Benares edn.). It may be contrasted with 'superior food' made from rice boiled in milk and sugar (paramānna; Meulen- beld 1974:471-2). For a discussion of the occurrence of the term avaränna in dharmasastra and ayurveda, see Gode 1956:153-60. 
The same issue concerning the ritual agency of the patni reaches a different conclusion in the Smrticandrikā. The ruling under dis- cussion there is Manu's statement that only one who is skilled in vaitāna (śrauta) rites and who has mastered the Veda may offer oblation. Those who do not qualify include the uninitiated, the fool, the man of little learning, and women (Manu XI.36–7). Manu's reference to a girl or young woman (naiva kanyā na yuvatir) is taken by Devannabhatta to include the patni (kanyāgrahaṇam patnya api pradarśanārtham; Sm.C.II.p.424). More important, Devannabhatta insists that the word agnihotra indicates that only the śrauta ritual is meant (tac chrautāgniviṣayam agnihotragrahaṇāt). He concludes with Gobhila (see note 48 below) that the patnī may if she likes (kāmam) make the morning and evening offerings (sāyamprātarhomau) into the aupāsana fire (gṛhyāgnau; Sm.C.II. 
p.424). 
In fact, Tryambaka too admits that 'the agency of the patni is accepted by some.'45 He quotes from six different authorities. According to Aśvalayana, 'one should perform the household ritual (grhyam for gṛhyāgnim) oneself from the time of marriage onwards (pāṇigrahaṇādi; glossed by Nār. as pāṇigrahaṇaprabhṛti); or one's patni, son, unmarried daughter (kumāri) or 'live-in pupil' 
45. anyais tu patnyäḥ kartrtvam angīkṛtam // Sdhp.9v.8-9.

Strīdharmapaddhati 
(antevāsī; glossed as sisyaḥ, Nār., Dev.) (should do it).’46 
The reference to the son implies a temporary substitute, for the man who hands over his ritual responsibilities to his son on a per- manent basis is held to have left the householder stage for the life of the hermit or renunciate. Kumārī denotes an unmarried daughter. In the context of the four ages of a woman, the term denotes a girl past puberty, who has left childhood (bālya) behind and is in the three-year (or three-month) period of adolescence during which a husband must be found (kaumāra, hence kaumārī). She has not yet reached the third stage (yauvana); for by then she should be married, and a married woman owes allegiance only to her husband and to the sacrifices pertaining to his household (see above, pp. 86-8). Two points should be noted here. First, the general tone of Tryambaka's treatise, combined with his insistence that a girl's fertile periods (ṛtu) should not be neglected (see section IV, pp. 287– 8) suggests that Tryambaka, like most later nibandhakāras, advo- cates prepubertal marriages for girls (cf. the discussion of nagnikā above, pp. 86-8). Such a view would not permit an adolescent girl to be still unmarried and in her father's house, and so able to take over his sacrificial duties. It is surprising that Tryambaka has not followed the example of the Smṛtimuktaphala and changed kumary to kuryād (Sm.M.II.p.355). As it stands, Āśvalāyana's ruling does not accord with the rest of Tryambaka's views. 
Secondly, the reference to kumārī in this context carries with it the assumption that the man in question has no son to act as tem- porary substitute. This in turn recalls the concept of the putrikā. If a man has no sons then, for religious purposes, he may 'reclassify' his daughter as a son. Both she and later her son will then perform the necessary funeral rites for her father. She may also inherit her father's property in the place of a real son (Manu IX.130). In Vasistha's list of the twelve kinds of sons deemed acceptable by the ancient seers, the 'appointed daughter' or putrikā is listed third (Vas.XVII.15). A parallel list in the Visnusmrti puts the son of such a daughter third (putrikāputra; Viş.Sm.XV.4). The rite of 'reclass- ification' takes place during the marriage ceremony when the bride's

father lays formal claim to his daughter's son (Vis.Sm.XV.5). By extension, any girl who has no brother, and who thus might be called upon to perform this duty, is called a putrikā (Viṣ.Sm.XV.6). Hence Manu's warning that a wise man should not marry a girl who has no brother (Manu III.11; Yājñ.I.53), for then his own funeral rites and those of his ancestors will be neglected. While Bühler produces both historical and contemporary evidence for the practice (1965:85–6, note 15), according to Kane it has been out of vogue for centuries (PVK II.1.p.435). We may assume that it is very rarely, if ever, encountered nowadays. In Tryambaka's case, it is a further de- monstration of the problem of quoting ancient texts to support an eighteenth-century point. 
Tryambaka continues. According to Vyasa, ‘a priest, (the householder's) son, patnī, pupil or, if he first obtains special permis- sion, his brother (sahodaraḥ) may offer sacrifice (in place of the householder) according to the usual rules.’47 
Sahodara means literally 'co-uterine', thus a brother born of the same mother. In the polygamous household envisaged by Tryam- baka, a man might have several half-brothers born of his father's different wives; these are excluded by Vyasa's ruling. We may also note that, unlike Aśvalāyana, Vyasa excludes the unmarried daughter too. 
According to Gobhila, ‘the patni should offer the two oblations of morning and evening into the domestic fire. '48 The reference to a single fire indicates that the aupāsana ritual is under discussion here, not the śrauta. Alternatively, according to Bhāradvāja, 'the wife may offer sacrifice, but without reciting the mantras.'49

Stridharmapaddhati 
According to Gautama, 'some people (eke) maintain that the patnī may offer sacrifice.'50 
Tryambaka concludes his case for the agency of the patni with two slokas from the Smṛtyarthasara. 'With regard to oblations, the sacrificer is the most important (i.e. the first choice); (failing him) his patni, son, unmarried daughter (kanyakā), priest (i.e. one employed by him), pupil, teacher, brother (bhrātṛ), sister's son or daughter's husband (may take his place). An oblation offered by any of these (people, i.e. on his behalf) is (held to have been) made by him alone. The patni and the unmarried daughter should perform the sacrifice without the act of sprinkling (water round the hearth).'51 
This is the most extensive of all the lists of substitute officiants. It includes the unmarried daughter, extends the notion of brother to include half-brother, and adds two more: sister's son and daughter's husband. We may assume that the wife and daughter are advised to omit the act of sprinkling water round the hearth on the grounds that it involves the recitation of Vedic mantras. In that case, however, it is not clear why the prohibition on reciting man- tras is not made explicit and extended to cover the entire ritual (as in the Bhāradvāja ruling). 
But perhaps the most important statement is that the sacrifice is always deemed to have been offered by the householder regardless of who actually officiates. The term yajamāna (‘sacrificer') exclusively denotes the male head of the household, on whom all ritual res- ponsibility rests whether he is physically present or not. Even when the wife is permitted to officiate, she never earns the title of 'sacri- ficer', not even temporarily. When her husband is present, she is his assistant; when he is absent, she may-according to some autho- rities - be his representative. But she may never perform a sacrifice herself.

Cf. Par.M.I.i.p.311 (Dakṣa).

149 
Tryambaka's own views are clear. The male head of the house- hold should always perform the śrauta sacrifice himself. If possible, he should perform the aupasana ritual himself too; if not, there is scriptural justification for the practice of using permitted substi- tutes, including the patni. Tryambaka's reluctance to allow this even in the case of the smärta ritual may be explained by the belief that a sacrifice performed by a substitute officiant produces a substandard result. According to Dakṣa, for example, the reward obtained by an oblation offered oneself (svayamhomaphalam) cannot be obtained by. proxy (Sm.C.II.p.422). For when a ritual is performed by someone else, the 'unseen result' (phalam adṛṣṭam) is halved (phalam ardham, Sm.C.II.p.422-3; cf. Sm.M.II.p.354-5; Par.M.I.i.p.311). But if the absence of the true sacrificer is unavoidable, a substitute or re- presentative may be assigned as detailed above. As Devanna- bhatta explains, these qualifications only apply when the sacrificer cannot perform the ritual himself (svayamhomālābhaviṣayam), because that alone is praised (tasyaiva prasastatvät; Sm.C.II.p.423). These rulings concerning substitute officiants must presumably be taken in conjunction with Tryambaka's earlier statement that a 'priest and so on' (rtvigādinā) should not perform the sacrifice in the absence of both husband and wife (see p. 132, note 29). Since only the husband may journey away from home, the implication is that, whoever is appointed to officiate in his absence, the patnī must still be there. 
The offering of respect to the sun (arghyadānam) 
The wife's final dawn duty, as described by Tryambaka, is that of offering worship to the rising sun. He explains. 'As soon as the oblation (homa) has been offered, the wife (striyā) should perform the (ritual of) presenting an offering of respect (arghyadānam) to the sun.'52 
The first point to note here is that, since Tryambaka seems to be concerned primarily with wives who assist at the śrauta ritual of agnihotra and only secondarily with those whose husbands perform the aupāsanahoma, the samdhyā ritual may be performed in the home rather than in a solitary or sacred place outside the village (see above pp. 105-6). It thus makes sense that the rulings on arghyadānam 
52. homānantaram striyā sūryāyārghyadānam kartavyam // Sdhp.10r.6. 
 
150 
Stridharmapaddhati 
are simply added on to those concerning the fire ritual, without any reference to the proper setting for their performance. 
Secondly, why does Tryambaka fail to give any rulings concerning the other actions normally associated with the samdhyā ritual: that is, the recitation of mantras (japa), sipping (ācamana), ritual breath- ing (prāṇāyāma), sprinkling with water (märjana), the ritual for driving out sin (aghamarṣana), the worship of the appropriate deity (upasthāna) and so on (e.g. PVK.II.i.p.315–19; Vidyāmṇava 1979; 32 ff.? Perhaps the answer is to be found in the earliest references to samdhyā. It seems that the oldest forms of the ritual involve only or principally two actions: offering water to the sun (arghya) and the recitation (japa) of the gãyatrī or săvitrī mantra (PVK II.i.p.314). According to Tait.Ar.II.2, for example, brahmavādins face east and throw upwards water that has been consecrated by the gāyatrī (samdhyāyām gāyatriyābhimantritā apa urdhvam vikṣipanti; p.121). Both the Asvalayana- and the Śānkhāyanagṛhyasūtra mention only the japa recitation (sävitrīm japet, Aśv.gr.III.7.4; Šānkh.gr.II.9.2). Mān.gr.I.2.2 mentions only the offering of water to the sun (añjalīm pūrayitva) and the gayatri. Not until the Baudhāyanadharmasūtra do we find any reference to the other elements associated with the ritual: bathing, sipping, sprinkling water (mantravat prokṣaṇam), japa recitation (sāvitrīm āvartayet), ritual breathing with mantras, and devotion to Varuna or Mitra (Baudh.II.4.7.1-11). Tryambaka is thus an exponent both of the more complex srauta ritual of agni- hotra and the more rudimentary form of samdhyā. There are two possible reasons for this. The more rudimentary ritual in accordance with earlier rather than later texts may be a mark of his extreme orthodoxy. Alternatively, and to my mind more probably, he gives us a truncated form of the ritual precisely because it is intended for women. As described, the ritual is in fact more like the various kinds of devotional worship performed by women all over India today. 
Tryambaka's omission of the japa recitation is predictable. For only twice-born males may recite Vedic mantras. As Baudhāyana explains in relation to another aspect of the samdhyā ritual, bathing is open to all varņas but sprinkling water over oneself while reciting mantras (mantravat prokṣaṇam) is restricted to the twice-born (Baudh.II.4.7.3); that is, according to the later understanding of the term, to the initiated male. In fact, in section IV of Tryambaka's treatise, japa meditation is included among the six things that cause 
 
At Dawn 
151 
a woman to 'fall' and which must therefore be avoided at all costs. (see pp. 274-6). Yet, according to Vidyarnava, this is the 'absolutely necessary' part of Hindu prayer: 'everyone, who calls himself a Hindu' should recite it (1979:33). Unfortunately, Vidyārṇava gives little thought to the part played by women in his scheme of Hindu devotional prayer. As his detailed account demonstrates, each part of the samdhyā ritual must be accompanied by a number of mantras. If women are unable to pronounce these mantras, then as Tryam- baka implies, much of the ritual is barred to them. 
Tryambaka's first point is to stress the importance of the ritual in terms of the future fortunes of the wife. According to Vyasa, 'the woman who presents an offering of respect to the sun in the early morning will not experience widowhood in her next seven lives. '53 The description of how she should perform the ritual (tat prakāram) is also attributed to Vyasa. 'The gods are pleased with the woman who constantly makes a circle (maṇḍalakam; i.e. of powder) outside (the house) and offers silent worship with unbroken rice and so on.'54 
The 'circle (of powder)' recalls the rangavalya patterns described in the section on threshold worship (pp. 63-4). 'Silent worship' (tūṣ- nīm püjayet) indicates that the wife should perform the ritual without the recitation of (Vedic) mantras. ‘Unbroken rice and so on' implies an offering of such things as unbroken rice, sacred grass, flowers, sandalwood paste and, presumably, water. 
There is an explicit if confusing analogy here between the ritual of showing respect to the sun and that of showing respect to an im- portant human guest such as an officiating priest, a learned teacher, a bridegroom or a king (ṣadarghyārhā[h], Mãn.gr.I.9.1; Aśv.gr.I.24. 1–4; Yājñ.I.111; cf. Gonda 1980:385-6). Indeed, as Kaus. Br.II.8.4 explains, he who offers sacrifice at sunrise is in fact offering hospita- lity (ātithyam karoti) to a great god starting on a journey. The ritual of respectfully offering water (arghya) is one of the principal com- ponents of the proper welcome of the guest in the madhuparka

ceremony described at some length in the gṛhyasūtras. The term madhuparka denotes an offering of honey or clarified butter and curds (Āśv.gr.1.24.5-6; Ap.gr.V.13.10; Hir.gr.I.12.11-12; PVK II.i.p.542ff.). The other items offered to the special guest include a seat of grass, a cow, and water intended for three distinct purposes: for washing the feet, as an offering of respect, and for sipping (pādyārtham arghyārtham ācamanārtham codakam; Nār. on Aśv. gr.I.24.7). When the guest has washed his feet, he receives the arghya water in cupped hands (arghyam añjalinā pratigṛhya ; Āsv.gr.I.24.11). Nārāyaṇa's comment provides the traditional definition of the term: water mixed with such things as perfume (e.g. sandalwood paste) and flowers (gandhamälyädisamyuktam udakam). 
If we turn to arghyadāna as a subsidiary component of the samdhyā ritual, we find that the offering of respect to the sun also consists of water. Par.M.I.i.p.295, for example, explains that after the ritual of sprinkling (mārjana) one should offer arghya to the sun. According to Vyasa, this consists of taking in one's two hands (karābhyām) water that has been consecrated by mantras (toyam 
gāyatryā cābhimantritam) and throwing it up three times in the direction of the sun (Par.M.I.i.p.296; Sm.C.II.p.362). The dis- cussion continues with a number of similar quotations also en- joining an offering to the sun consecrated by mantras (e.g. sävitryābhimantritam udakam, Hārīta; Par.M.I.i.p.296; Sm.C.II. p.362). In view of the references to the gayatri mantra, it is hardly surprising that Tryambaka does not produce any of these quota- tions to describe the arghyadāna ritual as performed by women. 
What is surprising, however, is that the offering of water has been replaced by a powder design and an offering of 'unbroken rice and so on'. In fact, the ritual hinted at by Tryambaka seems closer to the contemporary worship of images (devapijā) than to the tradit- ional ritual of samdhya. The offering of arghya water is certainly mentioned in one of the earliest descriptions of the devapüjā (Vis.Sm.65.3). In later accounts, however, arghyadāna consists of offering water mixed with all kinds of things such as rice, curds, kusa grass, milk, dūrvā grass, honey, grains of barley and so on (e.g. Matsy. P.267.2) The samdhyā ritual described in the Agnipurāna differentiates between the arghya offering made to the sun and that made to Śiva: the former consists of water accompanied by mantras (Ag.P.73.15); the latter is mixed with kusa grass, flowers and un-

153 
broken rice (kusapuṣpākṣatānvitam) accompanied by the gayatri (Ag.P.72.38). Since the Agnipurāṇa also stipulates that women may not recite Vedic mantras (153.12), the latter ritual, if not both, would seem to be barred to women. In the 'special arghya' ritual described by Vidyārṇava in his section on pūjā, the water is mixed with unbroken rice, sandalwood paste and flowers (1979:149-50). 
Tryambaka's next quotation, attributed to Madhava's com- mentary on the Parāśarasmṛti, is predictably not taken from the latter's section on arghyadāna (Par.M.I.i.p.295-6). For, as noted above, arghya is there defined as water consecrated with Vedic mantras. The quotation comes instead from the end of Madhava's section on tarpaṇa (the ritual of offering water to gods, sages and ancestors; Par.M.I.i.p.364). As Mādhava explains, after performing the various kinds of tarpana, one should sip water and then make an offering of water in cupped hands to the sun (dadyāt sūryāya sali- lāñjalim, Par.M.I.i.p.364; Vis.P.III.11.39a). Then follows the invocation to the sun selected by Tryambaka for the wife to declaim as she makes her arghya offering. It is taken from Aurva's discourse to Sagara on the 'fixed observances' (sadācāra) of the householder in the Visnupurāṇa and reads as follows. ‘Hail to the sun god, Brahman, radiant one, who has the fiery energy of Visnu, purifier of the world, the pure, the enlivener, who prods (us) to ritual action.'55 Śrīdharasvāmin glosses jagatsavitre as 'generating all' (viśvajana- kāya), karmadayine as 'precipitating ritual action' (karmapra- varttakāya). Unlike Tryambaka, neither Madhava nor Śrīdhara- svāmin (nor indeed Aurva) links this invocation with women. In fact, there are only two references to the special obligations of women in Aurva's entire discourse: according to the first, the wife should perform the vaiśvadeva ritual; according to the second, the householder should approach his wife for sexual intercourse in the evening as long as she is not sick, pregnant or menstruating. 
The invocation to the sun evidently constitutes an exception to or modification of the rule already given that women should perform the arghya ritual without reciting mantras (tūṣṇīm eva; see note 54).

Presumably, this is because the strict prohibition applies only to Vedic mantras, whereas this one comes from a purāna. It is certainly not to be found in Bloomfield's concordance of Vedic mantras (1964(2)). Yet this mantra is included by Vidyārṇava in the samdhyā rituals of orthodox males of two of the main Vedic schools (śākhā). Of the eighteen subdivisions of the Vedic samdhyā ritual outlined by Vidyāmava, six are devoted to the sun: an offering of water to greet the sun (sūryārgha); the worship of the sun (sūryopasthāna); a fare- well offering of water (suryärghya); obeisance to the sun (surya- namaskāra); a third offering of water (sūryārghya); and a final salutation (suryapraṇāma). Each of these, accompanied by mantras, is repeated three times a day. According to Vidyārṇava, the mantra specified by Tryambaka for women is recited by brahmins of the Rgvedic school during the third offering of water to the sun (1979:66). In the slightly different order of the Samavedic school, the same mantra is recited during the arghya offering to the sun at the end of the worship of Rudra (1979:89). It is curious that Vidyar- ṇava makes so much of the difficulties of pronouncing the Vedic language and thus of the need to bar the uneducated masses from performing these rituals (e.g. 1979:113) if some of the mantras cited are in fact purāṇic. Yet this particular mantra figures neither in the tantric version of the ritual developed precisely for the ex- excluded majority nor in the 'universal' ritual intended for ‘all mankind, irrespective of colour, caste, creed, race, sex, or nationali- ty' (Vidyarṇava 1979:113-19, 119-28). 
Tryambaka's final quotation in this section is attributed to the Agnipurāna. 'The chaste wife (sati) pays homage to the radiant one to ensure the long life and good health of her husband; she who desires the bliss of married life (saumangalyam) should bow down before brahmins. '56 Thus, while a man might be encouraged to worship the sun in order to ensure the dawning of a new day, or to gain 'unseen' merit, his wife's reward is seen in terms of the sur- vival and vigour of her husband. While he might be more impressed by talk of heaven or the rewards of the next life, she is coaxed into correct behaviour by the promise of saumangalya, the 'bliss of married life'. This contrast in the parallel rulings for husband and wife is typical.

At Dawn 
155 
This quotation brings to a close Tryambaka's comments on the dawn duties of the wife. I have dealt with this section in some detail for two reasons. First, it presents the wife's religious role in the nar- rower sense of her ritual obligations. Secondly, it demonstrates most clearly the odd mixture so typical of medieval texts: the signi- ficance of the wife in symbolic terms coupled with her unimportance in ritual actions. 
 
IIC Day 
(Sdhp. 10v.1-19v.4) 
Saluting one's elders (gurūņām abhivādanam; Sdhp.10v.1- 11r. 10). 
The wife's first duty after she has made her dawn offering to the sun (tadanantaram) is ‘to salute those to whom she owes respect (gurūṇām), using her ordinary name (abhivādanam)." Three points may be noted here. First, the formal salutation described is always made by an inferior to his or her superior. In the case of the wife, then, the action reinforces the family hierarchy each day. Secondly, the recipient's equally formal response is to bestow a blessing. This constitutes a validation in religious terms of the wife's homage. Thirdly, this is another case of a ruling usually made for men being applied to women (cf. Yājñ.I.26). 
The word guru in such contexts is usually a general term denoting anyone to whom an individual should show respect. For a man, the most important (atiguru) are father, mother and religious teacher (ācārya). These three are said to be equal to the three Vedas, the three great gods, the three worlds, and the three srauta fires (Vis. Sm.31.1-2,7; cf. Ap.I.4.14.6; Mbh.III.204.17-26). After these, respect is accorded to a man's senior relatives (e.g. uncles, grand- fathers, fathers-in-law, eldest brother, and their wives, Vis.Sm.32. 1-2; and older female relatives, Sm.C.I.89-90); to those of his teacher (Vis.Sm.32.5,14-15; Manu II.207); and to his 'elders' in general (vṛddha, Manu II.120) and presumably their wives too. 
Thus men are treated with the respect due to their own age and status; women according to that due to their husbands (pativayasaḥ striyah, Āp.I.4.14.21 and Har.; Vas.XIII.42). Although Vis.Sm.32.2 specifies here the wife of the same varṇa (see above; cf. Manu II.210), for most authorities the identification of wife with husband super- sedes any theoretical difference of varna. For, as Manu explains, even a woman of low birth merges with the man she marries as a river merges with the ocean (samudreṇaiva nimnagā), thus de- veloping the same qualities and becoming worthy of the same

honour (jagāmābhyarhaṇīyatām; Manu IX.22-4; cf. sections I, pp.34-9, and IIC, pp.221–7). 
Although the point is never stressed in dharmasastra, the word guru denotes a completely different set of relationships for women. 'Father' is replaced by 'husband's father', 'mother' by 'husband's mother', and 'teacher' by 'husband'. The difference demonstrates both the complete identification of the wife with her husband and her spiritual tutelage by him on her ordained religious path. The subsidiary groups of people to whom respect should be shown are correspondingly different: the husband's senior relatives rather than her own, and those of her husband's teacher. In this section, however, Tryambaka is concerned primarily with the first triad, consisting of parents-in-law and husband. 
The term abhivādana must be distinguished from several other kinds of greetings and salutations: namaskāra, pratyutthāna, upasam- grahana and pratyabhivāda. 
Namaskāra denotes the action of bowing with one's hands to- gether in a gesture of respect (añjali). According to the Smrtyartha- sāra, this is normally done towards images of deities (devatāpratimā), or illustrious individuals such as ascetics (yati) or renouncers (e.g. tridandin;Sm.A.p.8). Namaskāra may also be 'five-' or 'eight-limbed' (pañcānga or astanga) depending on the degree of prostration (Vir.P.p.88; Sm.M.II.p.389; cf. also suryanamaskāra, prostration to the sun). According to the Smṛticandrika, one should only per- form namaskāra in public assemblies, in sacrifices, or in palaces and royal courts (Sm.C.I.p.102; Visnu). Tryambaka, however, uses the term to describe the proper mode of respect owed by the wife to her husband in the home (see below, pp.162-3). 
Pratyutthāna denotes the action of rising respectfully from one's seat in order to receive someone. Certain individuals who do not merit the degree of respect implied by abhivadana or upasamgrahaṇa may be accorded this simpler gesture. For example, Baudhāyana rules that if an officiating priest (ṛtvik), father-in-law or uncle is younger than oneself, then one need only rise from one's seat and address him (pratyutthāyābhāṣaṇam, Baudh.I.2.3.45; pratyutthāna- mātreṇa pūjā, Har. on Gaut.VI.9). Gautama includes any aged person in this category, even a sudra (Gaut.VI.10). Pratyutthāna also precedes both upasamgrahana and abhivādana. 
Upasamgrahana is the salutation implying the greatest respect. 
 
158 
Stridharmapaddhati 
For example, it is the appropriate greeting for one's own teacher when one goes to him for instruction (Āp.I.2.5.18) and, according to some authorities, for one's parents and senior relatives (e.g. Gaut.1.6.1-3). The Smṛtyarthasara (p. 7) defines upasamgrahana as announcing one's gotra and name (amukagotro devadattaśarmā) and making a formal salutation (aham bho abhivadaye) while touching one's ears (karnau spṛṣṭvā), bending one's head (sirovana- manam) and clasping the person's feet, the right hand holding the right foot, the left hand the left foot (cf. Vis.Sm.28.15–16). 
Abhivādana consists of the same formal salutation and bending the head in respect, but omits the clasping of the person's feet with one's hands (abhivādane pādasamgrahaṇam nāsti; Sm.A.p.7). But it may include touching the person's feet (pädasparśanam kāryam na vā; Sm.A.p.7). In this way, for example, the student should greet his teacher early each morning (Āp.I.2.5.12). Abhivādana is also the usual form of salutation offered by an inferior to his superior. To ensure the correct degree of inclination, Āp.I.2.5.16 rules that the brahmin should make his salute while holding his right arm level with his ear (śrotrasamam); the kṣatriya with his chest (uraḥsamam); the vaisya with his waist (madhyasamam; glossed by Har. as udara- samam or alternatively ūrusamam, that is, level with his stomach or thighs); and the sudra by holding his arm out low (nīcaiḥ; glossed by Har. as pādasamam, level with his feet; cf. Sm.C.I.p.96). There is no ruling for women but perhaps we may assume that they would again be grouped with the sūdra. Manu II.120 explains the need to per- form this ritual greeting. When an elder (sthavira) approaches a younger person (yuna), the latter's vital breaths (prānā[h]) rise upwards (utkrāmanti), desiring to leave the body (dehad bahir nirgantum icchanti; Medh.); but by rising from one's seat and mak- ing a formal salutation (pratyutthänābhivādābhyām) one can re- claim them once more. If we relate the ruling to women, however, we should substitute 'inferior' for 'younger' and 'superior' for 'older' for, as noted above, the age of the woman herself is im- material. 
This formal greeting may be performed as a daily (nitya) ritual (e.g. Āp.1.2.5.12-13), or as an occasional (naimittika) ritual (e.g. when returning from a journey, Āp.I.2.5.14), or in order to attain certain results (kāmya) such as heaven and long life (Āp.I.2.5.15; Manu II.121). Tryambaka's primary concern here is with the obligatory daily ritual to be performed by the wife after the dawn 
 
Day 
observances and before the practical tasks of the morning. 
159 
When a brahmin greets his elder or superior, the traditional salutation is in three parts: the formal 'I salute' (abhivādaye); the declaration of one's name; and the respectful vocative bhoḥ (Manu II. 122-4; Viş.Sm.28.17; Gaut.I.6.5). However, if the recipient is an ignorant man, that is, one who does not understand the salutation (Manu II.123), then it is abbreviated. In that case, the speaker should omit both the respectful bhoḥ and his name, saying only 'It is I' (aham iti brūyāt; Manu II. 123). We have already noted that women are to be accorded the status and respect due to their husbands. In this context, however, Manu groups all women together with ignorant men (Manu II.123). Āpastamba even rules that a brahmin greeting either a kṣatriya, vaiśya or a woman should use the pro- noun instead of his own name (sarvanämnä... na nämnā; Ap. 1.4.14.23). The Smṛticandrikā lists the purificatory rituals ap- propriate for a brahmin who gives a ritual greeting to a kṣatriya, vaisya or sudra (Sm.C.I.p.101-2); a woman is presumably an un- worthy recipient too. 
A similar distinction occurs in the rulings concerning the equally formal reply to such a salutation (pratyabhivāda). The rules govern- ing this reply may be found in Panini's section on vowels lengthened to three moras (pluta). When the salutation made by a non-sudra is returned, the final vowel in the name given at the end of that reply is pluta (pratyabhivāde 'sūdre, Pan. VIII.2.83; cf. Manu II.125-6; Har. on Gaut.1.6.5). It follows by Paninian convention that if a sudra makes the salutation, the name given in the formal reply is not lengthened in this way. Patañjali interprets the reference to the śūdra to include women and those who behave in a disrespectful way (aśūdrastryasuyakeṣv iti vaktavyam) and applies it optionally to kṣatriyas and vaiśyas (Pat. on Pan.VIII.2.83, p.416). Thus the reply to a formal salutation from Gārgi is: ayuṣmati bhava gārgi (without the pluta lengthening). 
Patanjali provides an interesting footnote. One of his arguments for the importance of the study of vyākaraṇa includes a sloka to the following effect: if one does not know the proper response to a salutation (the rules of pluta), then one is in danger of being saluted with the form used for women (cf. Manu II.123 above); to avoid this, one should learn one's grammar (abhivāde strīvan mā bhūmety adhyeyam vyākaraṇam; Pat. on Pan.I.1.1., p. 3). The same śloka is quoted by, among others, Medhätithi (on Manu II.123) and 
 
160 
Stridharmapaddhati 
Haradatta (on Gaut.I.6.5), thus demonstrating that this point was taken seriously in dharmasastra too. Manu II.126 adds that a brahmin who does not know the rules of pratyabhivāda is to be treated as a sudra and not saluted at all. 
From the earliest times, an individual was given three or even four names. Sāyaṇa's classification (on R.V.VIII.80.9), for example, consists of a name derived from the nakṣatra on which one was born (nakṣatranāma), a secret name (guhyam nāma), a name known and used publicly (prakāśam nāma), and a fourth name derived from the performance of a sacrifice (turīyam nāma yajñiyam, R.V.VIII.80. 9; somayājīti, Say.). The appellation yajvan of 'Tryambakayajvan' belongs to this fourth category. 
The two names that concern us here are the ordinary name, usual- ly termed vyāvahārika (or vyavahāropayuktanāma, as here), and the secret name (guhyam; e.g. Gobh.gr.II.7.15-16; Hir.gr.II.4.13), termed abhivādanīya (e.g. Āśv.gṛ.I.15.10). The former is self-ex- planatory: it is the name by which a person is generally known. According to the elaborate rules set out in Aśv.gr.I.15.4-9, the ordinary name for a boy should have two or four syllables, and should begin with a sonant and end with a visarga; while that for a girl should have an uneven number of syllables (three according to Mān.gr.I.18.1; see Manu II.33 for further rules regarding girls' names). This is the name bestowed on a child in the naming cere- mony (nāmakaraṇa) that takes place on the tenth or twelfth day after birth (Ap.gr.VI.15.8-11; Baudh.gr.II.1.23ff.; Manu II.30). The issue is seriously confused, however, by the fact that similar elaborate rules set out in Sankh.gr.I.24.4-5 apply to the (secret) name given at birth. Verse 6 explains that the ordinary name is given later, on the tenth day. 
But both texts agree that the secret name (abhivādanīya; Āśv.gṛ. 1.15.10) is known only to the child's parents until the initiation ceremony. It is the name with which the initiated child or person makes his formal salutations (yena nämnopanīto 'bhivādayate; Nār.on Asv.gr.I.15.10). But even this is disputed by some autho- rities. The Gobhilagṛhyasūtra, for example, distinguishes between the secret name given at birth (Gobh.gr.II.7.15-16); the ordinary name, derived according to elaborate directions and given at the name-giving ceremony (Gobh.gr.II.8.8,14-16); and the abhivādanī- ya name received at the initiation ceremony (Gobh.gr.II.10.21-5). 
 
Day 
161 
There is even the suggestion that the last of these is received from the teacher himself. 
For our purposes, however, we need only distinguish between the ordinary name used every day (vyāvahārikanāma) and the one used by the initiated person for formal salutations to this teacher and more learned elders (abhivādanīyanāma). Haradatta's comment on Gaut.I.6.5 explains when each should be used. The sūtra itself rules that 'on meeting those who know' (jñasamavāye), the salutation should be made 'using one's own name' (svanāma procya). Hara- datta's comment falls into two parts. When meeting someone who knows how to make the proper response (yaḥ pratyabhivadanā- bhijñas tena samgame), one should use one's ordinary public name (vyāvahārikam prasiddham nāma). But with regard to those who actually understand the meaning of the salutation (arthajñānām), when meeting such excellent acquaintances (jñātavarasamavāye), one should use one's secret name (svanāma guhyam). 
The implication of Tryambaka's ruling is now clear. For one of the major assumptions on which Tryambaka's treatise is based is that women are not entitled to initiation (see section I, pp.34–9). If this is so, then there can be no secret or abhivādanīya name for women. Thus any formal salutation made by a woman necessarily entails her ordinary or vyavahāropayukta name. Tryambaka returns to this topic in his comments on offering obeisance to one's husband (see below, pp. 162–3). 
In the context of names, we may also note that a number of individuals are traditionally not to be addressed by name, as a mark of respect. These include one's husband and one's wife as well as one's father, mother, uncle, father-in-law and mother's sister, one's teacher (ācārya), his wife and son, one's guru or benefactor (hitaiṣin), an initiated person (dīkṣita) and a learned one (vidvāms; Har. on Gaut.I.2.29). In his section on general behaviour, Tryambaka stresses the point that the good wife never utters her husband's name (Sdhp.23r.3-4; section IV, pp. 273-4). Even today in Maharashtra, the traditional wife will say 'My husband is out', without men- tioning his name. A generation ago, that too would have been con- trary to strict tradition: she would have said, "The coat is not here' or 'I see no turban', thereby implying her husband's absence (LSJ). 
Tryambaka begins with the homage (pädavandanam) a woman owes her parents-in-law. According to a half-sloka from Yajnavalkya 
162 
Stridharmapaddhati 
(attributed by Tryambaka to Vijñānesvara), 'the woman who is devoted to her husband (bhartṛtatparā) should pay homage to the feet of her parents-in-law."2 It is not clear (either from Tryambaka or from Yājñavalkya) whether this involves clasping both feet as in upasamgrahana or merely touching the feet (pädaspassana; see above, pp. 157-60). According to Gautama, upasamgrahaṇa is appropriate (Gaut.I.6.1-3). In traditional areas of India today, however, when the gesture is performed by a man, the joined hands touch the recipient's feet or the ground once. But when performed by a woman, they touch the ground alone and then are shaken brief- ly up and down. Judging by the customs still in force today, there- fore, upasamgrahana is not appropriate for women. Either way, the ruling presupposes the custom of living in a joint family. 
Vijñāneśvara glosses bhartṛtatparā as 'a virtuous wife, obedient to the will of her husband' (bhartrvaśavartinī satī). ‘Parents-in-law' (śvaśurayoḥ) is extended to include other people worthy of this honour (mänyāntaropalakṣaṇārtham; cf. Pāṇ.1.2.71). For example, when Rāma determines to go into exile without Sītā, he reminds her of the proper way to start her day: rise at dawn, worship the gods, pay homage to his father (vanditavyo daśarathaḥ pită mama), his mother Kausalyā, and all his step-mothers, offering her services to each in turn (Ram.II.26.30–2). 
For the obeisance of the wife to her husband, Tryambaka uses the term namaskāra. As noted above, this term-usually reserved for the worship of images or for paying homage to august individuals -covers respectful gestures ranging from the bowing of the head with hands together to the full prostration of the body. It is clear that Tryambaka considers full obeisance appropriate here. In his section on women's property, for example, Kausalyā is described paying homage to her husband, saying 'I bow my head to you (prasādaye tvām śirasā); I am prostrate on the ground before you (bhūmau nipatitasmi te).' For Tryambaka, this is the mark of the true pativratā (kausalyāyāḥ pativratādharmānuṣṭhānāvagamāt; Sdhp.26[2]v.2–4, from the section on strīdhanam, pp.277–80). 
In this section, however, 'further details regarding the obeisance due to the husband (bhartṛnamaskāre) are provided by Gautama.'

The quotation concerns the name the wife should use in the saluta- tion, and reads as follows. 'Some authorities maintain that there is no rule regarding salutations between a man and a woman (strīpum- yoge; glossed by Haradatta as jāyāpatisamavāye, "when wife and husband meet")."3 Since a superior never salutes an inferior, what is at issue here is how a wife should salute her husband and not vice versa (jāyaya bhartur abhivādane; Mask. on Gaut. VI.6). According to Tryambaka's explanation, 'this means that there is no rule to the effect that when such a salutation is being made (by the wife to the husband), an abhivādanīya name must be used; she should use instead whatever ordinary name (vyavahāropayukta) is current at that time.' The implications of this statement are discussed above. Haradatta and Maskarin say much the same thing, adding only one proviso. If the husband knows the rules of formal responses (yady api bhartă pratyabhivādanajñaḥ; Har., Mask.) then there is no need for any modifying rule (aham ayam ity evamādi niyamo nāsti; Mask.); she may use any form of address (yena kenacit prakāreṇa kartavyam, Mask.). 
As noted briefly above, the morning salutation is closely associated with, and usually followed by, a variety of personal services. Ac- cording to Tryambaka, 'the wife should perform such services (śuśruṣaṇam) herself, whether for parents-in-law or husband, even if other attendants (servants) are available.' In support of this statement, Tryambaka quotes from several different episodes in the Mahabharata. To avoid repetition, I have taken these quotations out of sequence: the first group applies to the parents-in-law, the second to the husband (see notes 6–12). 
The behaviour appropriate to one's in-laws is described in a śloka taken from Draupadi's advice to Satyabhama on the proper conduct of the wife as given in the Vanaparvan (draupadisatya- bhāmāsamvādaparvan, Mbh.III.222-4; cf. section IV, pp. 280-1).

She describes her own behaviour towards her senior mother-in-law. 'With regard to liquid refreshment, clothes and food, I always attend upon the noble Kunti, mother of heroes, speaker of truth, myself.'6 
Another sloka to the same effect is taken from Draupadi's long complaint to Bhima in the Virāṭaparvan concerning the miseries of her life disguised as a maid-servant at the court of Virața (Mbh.IV. 16.5–IV.20.35). Showing Bhīma her calloused hands, Draupadi exclaims: 'I who have never ground sandalwood paste myself even to apply it to my own body-only to Kunti's-see, if you please, how I am grinding it today!"7 The implication is clear: sandalwood for her own use would be ground by a servant; that for Kunti she would, as a mark of special respect, always grind herself. 
A third quotation on this subject is taken from the last part of Uma's discourse to Maheśvara on the duties of women in the Anuśānaparvan (umāmaheśvarasamvadaḥ; Mbh.XIII.126–134; cf. pp. 161-2). “That which is to be done for one's parents-in-law (should be performed) with the same respect as is due to one's husband. That woman, endowed with virtues, who pays homage to (toṣayanti; lit. ‘gratifying' or 'appeasing') the feet of her parents-in- law and is always devoted to her mother and father, is rich in reli- gious austerity.'8 
The behaviour appropriate to one's husband is described in a second sloka from Draupadi's advice to Satyabhāmā in the Vana- parvan (cf. note 6). 'And when the maid-servant has been sent away, rise up (yourself): one should do everything oneself. Let Krsna know your feelings (bhāva), Satya, let him think "She (loves and)

Further evidence to the same effect comes from Bhīṣma's dis- course to Yudhisthira on the division of inheritance in the Anusă- sanaparvan (rikthavibhāga; Mbh.XIII.47). ‘If the wife is there, no one else should ever attend to (make the preparations for) her hus- band's bath, toilette, teeth-cleaning, collyrium, oblations to the gods, offerings to the ancestors, or anything else relating to his religi- ous duty (dharmayuktam) in the home.'10 In the context of Tryam- baka's treatise, the phrase 'no one else' excludes servants and the 'other attendants' (paricāraka) referred to earlier. In the con- text of the Mahābhārata, it is intended to exclude all junior wives. Tryambaka takes this point next. 
Like Bhisma in his discourse to Yudhisthira (and with similar incongruence), Tryambaka takes the brahmin and not the kṣatriya as his case in point. 'Although-in all ages except the kali age-- marrying (women of) other varṇas is (permitted) for a brahmin man, (those tasks listed above) should be performed only by his brahmin wife.'11 Continuing to quote from Bhisma's lecture to Yudhisthira, but out of sequence, Tryambaka explains. '(Even if) he marries a brahmin woman after he has (already) taken three wives (of other varnas), she should be his senior wife (jyeṣṭhā), the one worthy of honour, the superior one. This brahmin wife alone should perform (those services) for that brahmin man, O Yudhi- sthira. Food, liquid refreshment, garlands, clothes and ornaments should be given to the husband by his brahmin wife, for she is the superior one. And if he does otherwise due to infatuation (kāmāt, i.e. for another wife; mohat, Manu IX.87), O Yudhisthira, then, as

was foreseen by the ancients, he will become a candāla among brah- mins.'12 
Several points may be made here. First, the classification of daily duties such as bathing, teeth-cleaning and so on as 'relating to religious duty' (dharmayuktam) means that the wife's services in these matters are classed as services in the religious sphere. A similar verse in Manu (IX.86) groups the wife's personal services to her husband (bhartuḥ śarīrasuśruṣām) and her religious obligations towards him (dharmakaryam) together as complementary parts of her religious path. The rules in operation here are thus much the same as those described earlier for selecting a dharmapatni for religious rituals proper (section IIB, pp. 121-8). 
Secondly, it is curious that Tryambaka quotes in full a sloka that in fact prohibits the marrying of women from other varnas in the kali age. For there is no doubt, either historically or within the context of this treatise, that polygamy of this kind figured pro- minently in Tryambaka's world. Perhaps we should assume that the general rule concerning the pre-eminence of the senior wife of the same caste applies to all three varnas (cf. Manu IX.86), whereas the sub-rule prohibiting marriages with wives of other varņas applies only to the more elevated brahmin (such as Tryambaka himself). Certainly, polygamy is the mark of the prosperous and military kṣatriya class (cf. section IIB, pp. 121–8). 
Finally, the epithet brāhmaṇacanḍāla in a similar verse in Manu is defined by Raghavananda as 'one who is regarded as a candāla because of his despicable behaviour' (kutsitācāratvāc caṇḍālavad upekṣyaḥ; Ragh. on Manu IX.87). The different spellings of candala (cāndāla) are correct. 
These rulings regarding the proper behaviour of the wife (and in particular, the senior wife or jyestha) towards her husband are

strongly reminiscent of those describing the proper behaviour of the student towards his teacher. According to Baudhayana, for example, the duties of the student include attending to his teacher's morning toilet (prasādhana), rubbing his body with oil (ucchādana; alter- natively utsādana, shampooing'), helping him bath (snapanam), eating the remains of his meal (ucchiṣṭa; cf. pp. 221–7), and so on (Baudh. 1.2.3.35). By the process of identification mentioned above, he should perform the same services for his teacher's wife (Baudh. I.2.3.37), although Manu's condemnation of this practice (II.211) seems more in keeping with orthodox views on the natural pro- miscuity of women (see section III). In his eagerness to be of service, the student should run after his teacher if he runs (dhā- vantam anudhāvet), walk with him when he walks (gacchantam anugacchet), stand beside him when he stands (tiṣṭhantam anutiṣṭhet; Baudh.I.2.3.38; Ap.1.2.6.7-9; Vas. VII.12; Manu II.196). Manu II.202 adds that the student should not employ anyone else to honour his teacher while he himself stands apart (durasth[ah]; parahastapreșitapraṇāma, Sarv.; anyam niyujya malyavasträdinā gurum närcayet, Kull.). In the same way, while she may delegate her more mundane household tasks (see section IIA, pp. 64–5), the ideal wife should not delegate any service to her husband to another, whether servant or co-wife. 
Perhaps the supreme reinforcement of this parallel, combined with the adulation of in-laws, is to be found in the story of the mon- goose (nakulopākḥyāna; Mbh.XIV.91-6, esp.93.50-1), surprisingly not cited by Tryambaka. The story relates how a poor brahmin lived with his wife, son and daughter-in-law in abject poverty during a famine. When the god Dharma appears in the guise of a guest, the brahmin gives him his last measure of ground barley. Begging to be allowed to follow his example, the daughter-in-law delivers an impassioned speech on the homage due to the father-in-law. 'You are the guru of my guru (guror mama gurus tvam) since you are the god of my god (yato daivatadaivatam). Thus you are the supreme god of gods (devātidevaḥ). Everything-my body, my life (prāṇaḥ), my religious duty (dharma) is intended solely to serve my guru (suśrūṣārtham idam guroh). Through your grace (tava prasādena), I shall attain the desired heavenly worlds.' 
The three atigurus of a woman's religious life are her husband and her parents-in-law. By serving them devotedly all her life, as a

perpetual student serves his teacher (cf. Manu II.243-4, 249), she will achieve the highest reward. 
Household tasks (2) (grhakṛtyam ;Sdhp.11r.10-12v.5) 
According to the traditional eightfold division of the day, a man should devote the second part to Vedic study, and the third to the maintenance of his family (Dakṣa II.33-5; Yājñ.1.99–100; Vidyā- mṇava 1979:1; see pp.45-9). According to Tryambaka, however, women are excluded from Vedic study; and any work they do should be within the home. The good wife should therefore devote the equivalent period of the day (i.e. from dawn to shortly before midday) to household tasks. As Tryambaka explains, ‘after that (i.e. after making the appropriate salutations to husband and in-laws), she should attend to (lit. “consider”) her household duties. '13 
Tryambaka opens this section with a śloka (attributed to Vyāsa) describing the general qualities appropriate to the ideal wife. 'She should be one who brings good luck, one for whom it is natural to perform auspicious acts, one who loves making (the home) beautiful and contributing (in other ways) to the household.'14 The first of these is a practical requirement. For a woman's power to bring good luck may be manifested in two ways: she is the mother of healthy sons, and her husband is alive and prosperous. 
Tryambaka proceeds to describe in more detail one very important contribution (upakāra) the wife may be required to make. 'When commissioned to do so by her husband, she should perform such tasks as managing the (household) income.'15 Tryambaka's evidence is drawn from Manu. 'He (the husband) should put her in charge of saving and spending money, keeping things (clean and) pure (sauce), religious matters (dharme), the preparation of food, and looking after the household utensils.'16

The comment that follows is Tryambaka's. ""Saving money" means "keeping it safe". "Spending" means "in ways not prohi- bited by the rulings of dharmaśāstra”. “Keeping things pure” covers "objects, the body and so forth". "Religious matters" means "such things as offering hospitality to guests". "The preparation of food" means "cooking it". "(Looking after) the household utensils" means "seeing to such household paraphernalia as beds, seats, water-pots and frying-pans". (This is how) he should employ his wife.'17 
Several points may be noted here. First, the reference to 'reli- gious matters' (dharma) is predictably interpreted to emphasize the more obviously domestic aspects of the wife's religious role: feeding her husband's guests rather than participating in the fire sacrifice or paying homage to the gods. 
Secondly, while Tryambaka quotes Manu's ruling merely to support his statement that the wife should be called upon to act as household treasurer, the original context of that ruling is far less complimentary. For Manu IX.9 cautions men that if they wish to keep their offspring pure (prajāviśuddhyartham), they should guard their wives closely. Verse 10 adds that while no one can guard women by force (prasahya), they may be guarded by the following means (etair upayayogais tu). These 'means' are spelled out in the verse Tryambaka has quoted: that is, women should be kept busy with household responsibilities. Verse 12 concludes that women con- fined under guard are not in fact guarded at all (arakṣitā[h]); those who in this way keep guard over themselves (ātmānam ātmanā yās tu rakṣeyuh) are (surakṣitāḥ). For a woman who is not kept busy might hang around the doorway looking out into the street, some- thing Tryambaka expressly forbids (Sdhp.23r.6-7, from section IV, pp. 273-4), probably because that is believed to be one of the marks of a woman who is easily seduced (dvāradeśāvasthāyinī; Kām. V.1.52). 
After a digression on whether or not the wife may speak to other men (pp. 170-6), Tryambaka returns to the subject of managing money. To avoid repetition, I include the relevant comment and quotation here. 
17. asyārthaḥ // arthasya samgrahane rakṣane vyaye sastrāviruddhe sauce dravyasrīrādeḥ/dharme atithyadike 'nnapaktyām tatpäke pärinähyasya gṛho- pakaraṇasya sayyasan kundakatähäder ikṣane tam striyam niyojayed iti// Sdhp.11v.3-6. (I have followed PT in correcting 'paskaraṇasya to ‘paka- ranasya.)

Strīdharmapaddhati 
Tryambaka explains. 'With the money given (to her by her husband) to cover her household tasks, the chief wife (patnī) should carry out those tasks in whatever way she can and (still) keep some- thing back. But she should not keep anything back out of greed from the money given (to her) for religious purposes (dharm- ärtham).'18 As evidence for this, Tryambaka quotes one and a half slokas attributed to Manu that say much the same thing. 'The husband should place in his wife's charge (lit. "hand") the money which is to be spent on the home. She should carry out her household tasks and (yet in doing so) deliberately keep something back. But if she is given money for the purpose of religious donation (dän- ārtham), she should not keep any of that back out of greed.'19 
Two points should be made here. First, both Tryambaka's state- ment and the quotation that follows use the word patnī, indicating that the role of household treasurer is to be taken by the senior wife of the same caste as her husband. Presumably the same rules of selection discussed above (see pp. 121-8) would operate in this sphere too. 
Secondly, Tryambaka's phrase 'for religious purposes' (dharm- ārtham) is replaced in the quotation by 'for religious donation' (dānārtham). The latter more specific term excludes such possibili- ties as the wife buying the items required for a sacrifice or paying the priests. It also raises the much-debated question of whether or not the wife owns any money or property herself, and thus whether she may give or withhold religious donations in her own right. Tryambaka returns to this question in his section IV on women's property (see pp. 277-80). 
The rest of this section on household tasks is taken up with a lengthy discussion of whether or not the ideal wife may talk to other men (a topic also raised in Sdhp.24r.1-24v.7, see section IV, pp. 273– 4); cf. Dharmāk.III.p.175ff.). Strictly speaking, the term parapurușa denotes any man other than her husband; by extension, as Tryam-

baka eventually explains, it denotes any man who is not related to her. 
Tryambaka presents the problem. "The objection may be made (nanu) that a woman cannot attend to her household tasks without speaking to other men and yet, because of the prohibition "she should not speak to any other man”, this is not allowed. But this objection is not valid (iti cen na).'20 For that same prohibition (attributed here to Sankha), when given in full, in fact runs as follows. 'She should not talk to any other man apart from traders, renouncers (pravrajita°), doctors and old men.' It thus allows women to 'converse with those men who are instrumental in her affairs',21 
We may note here that while a woman may converse with a male renouncer she may have nothing to do with his female counterpart. For in section IV, there is an even fuller version of this quotation. It culminates in a list of women with whom the good wife should not associate: courtesans (gaṇikā), women who gamble (dhūrtā), women who meet lovers in secret (abhisārini), female renouncers (pravrajitā), and so on (Sdhp.22v.1-3, see pp. 273-4). The term pravrajitā includes both traditional female ascetics and the heretical orders of nuns. A similar passage attributed to Markandeya rules that the good wife should never be friendly with a female sceptic (haitukī) or a female religious mendicant (śramanā, Sdhp.23v.5-6; see also section IV, note 26). The former term condemns women who question the traditional values preached by Hindu orthodoxy; the latter condemns those who have already rejected them. The ortho- dox viewpoint is clear. Men may choose to renounce family life and devote themselves to their religion; women may not. For a woman's religion is her family life. Hence the ruling in Tryambaka's section on things to be avoided: renunciation (pravrajya) is one of the six things that cause women and sūdras to fall (see section IV, note 7). We should add here that female mendicants are also under suspicion

for another reason altogether: they (together with widows) are included in the list of 'go-betweens' (dūtī) considered suitable for conducting illicit affairs (bhikṣukī; Kām.V.4.62). 
But what should the good wife do if neither husband nor male relative is there to speak on her behalf? Tryambaka tackles this question next. 'In times of difficulty-that is, when there is no other speaker except a man unrelated to her (i.e. no one else who might speak for her)—then she will not be at fault if she speaks to him either after placing a blade of grass between the two of them (tṛṇam antarataḥ kṛtva) or directly (sākṣād)."22 For each of these possibilities, Tryambaka produces an epic example. 
First, the custom of placing a blade of grass between the chaste wife and an unrelated man as a symbolic barrier is traced to an incident described in the Rāmāyaṇa (Rām.V.21). Sītā has been carried off to Lankā by the demon Rāvaṇa who proceeds to declare his love. Tryambaka's quotation-in fact taken from the version of the Rāmāyana embedded in his Dharmākūta-details Sītā's response. 'Addressed in this way (by Ravana), Sītā, tormented by grief, was without fear. Placing a blade of grass between them (trnam antarataḥ kṛtva), she answered Rāvana. '23 
The crucial phrase, tṛṇam antarataḥ kṛtvā, appears both in the Rāmāyaṇa episode (Rām. V.21.1-3) and in the Mahabharata's version of the story (rāmopākhyānam, Mbh.III.265.17; see note 23). Van Buitenen (1978:III, p.741) translates the latter as 'counting him no more than a straw in her heart'. However, there is a confusion here between the literal meaning of the phrase and the metaphorical meaning expressed by the cvi formation trnikṛ (cf.Pan.V.4.50 ff.). It seems evident, both from the Sanskrit itself and from Tryambaka's interpretation of it, that the literal meaning is intended here: Sītā actually places the grass between them, thereby establishing a

symbolic 'barrier' between herself and the parapuruşa with whom she should not converse. It is quite likely, of course, that the phrase is also a kind of pun, evoking the contempt of the cvi formation. Certainly, in the Madras edition I have used, the chapter describing the incident is entitled rāvanatṛnikaranam (Rām.V.21, subheading). But a translation that completely omits the literal meaning misses the point.24 
Tryambaka's example of a good woman speaking directly to an unrelated man (without a symbolic grass 'barrier') is taken from the 'abduction of Draupadi' episode in the Vanaparvan of the Mahābhārata (draupadipramathe, Sdhp.11v.11; draupadiharaṇa- parvan, Mbh.III.248-53). The five Pandavas have gone hunting, leaving Draupadi alone in the forest. King Jayadratha, who is looking for a wife (vivāhakāmaḥ; Mbh.III.248.6), sees Draupadi and sends his friend, King Koṭikāśya, to find out who she is. Mbh. III.250 presents Draupadi's response to Kotikāsya's questions; Tryambaka quotes most of it. 
'Questioned in this way by the chief of the Sibis, Princess Drau- padi looked at him slowly (mandam). (Van Buitenen's "with a languid glance" does not, I think, convey the implied reluctance of a high-born woman confronted with someone to whom she should not normally speak.)-Letting go the branch (she had been holding), she gathered together her silken upper garment (samgṛhnati kausikam uttarīyam; that is, she drew the garment demurely across her face and upper body; cf. van Buitenen's "kuśa grass skirt") and spoke.25 "O son of Narendra, I know in my heart (buddhyā) that a woman like me is not permitted to converse with you. But you have spoken and there is no one else here to answer you, neither man nor woman; for I am on my own at present. I shall answer you for this reason (i.e. and this reason alone)—be sure, sir, that you understand this. (Van Buitenen's 'listen well' conveys neither her anxiety nor her reasoning.) For I am alone in the forest, ruled by my own religious law (niyatā svadharme; i.e. as an orthodox wife), so how may I con-

verse with you when you are also here alone ?26 I (already) know that you are Suratha's son, whom men call Kotikāśya. I shall therefore do the same for you, O Śaibya, and tell you about my relations and my celebrated family.27 (Tryambaka in fact omits verse 5 which ex- plains that she is Drupada's daughter and the wife of the five Pandavas.) The sons of Pṛthả (Kuntī as chief wife)- Yudhisthira, Bhimasena and Arjuna, and the two most heroic sons of Mādrī— have left me here and gone out hunting in each of the four direc- tions.28 (Tryambaka omits the half-verse that describes which husband went where.) But I think it is almost time for these supreme charioteers to return here. When you have received (due) honour from them, you may go as you wish; (until then) unharness your horses and dismount. (Yudhisthira,) the great-souled son of Dharma loves to receive guests and so he will be pleased to see you.29 Saying so much (i.e. and no more) to the son of the Saibya king, Drupada's moon-faced daughter departed. Thinking (only) of her duty to offer hospitality to them (as her husbands' guests), she entered that excellent hut made of leaves. '30

men to whom they are not related'. He adds that 'there is no blame attached to conversing with those to whom they are related (svīyaiḥ saha).'31 We need only note here that Tryambaka's extremely orthodox advice is of no practical value to either Sītā or Draupadi. Each in turn follows the rules of stridharma to the letter; both are abducted anyway. Tryambaka's satisfaction with their behaviour stems not from the success of either strategem but from the fact that, in orthodox eyes, neither Sitä nor Draupadi is to blame. For a woman that is small consolation. 
This topic is evidently dear to Tryambaka's heart for it reappears at some length in his section on general behaviour (section IV, pp.273- 4). The picture he paints there of the perfect wife still holds good for traditional India today. Even if another man entices her with good things (lobhitapi pareṇārthaih), begs her humbly (dainyena prarthitā vāpi), seizes her by force (balena vidhṛtāpi vā), or clothes her in fine garments (vastrādyair vāsitā vāpi), the good wife never loves another man (the term bhajate implying here love, homage, domes- tic service and sexual favours; cf. section I, introductory verse 1). If another man looks at her, she does not meet his eyes (vīkṣitā vīkṣate nānyam); if he smiles at her, she does not smile back (hasita na hasaty api); if he speaks to her, she does not answer (bhāṣitā bhāṣate nānyam). By implication (according to the pramana of arthapatti accepted by mīmāmsā), touching another man is also prohibited (sparso 'pi arthāt pratiṣidhyate; Sdhp.24r.1-24v.7). This is still the description of the virtuous Hindu wife today, especially in the north, even in the comparatively modern middle class.32 In the south, however, the women seem noticeably more relaxed. If this was also the case in Tryambaka's time, it would

32. While men may be open in their dealings with others, their wives (whether accompanied by their husbands or not) will not talk to or smile at other men. As a result, brahmin men usually do not bother to address the wives of their friends or colleagues because they are almost certain to meet with no response (LSJ). The custom persists even among the new generation of college girls: a male medical student complained to me that his female colleagues would not talk to or look at him even when they were engaged in dissecting a corpse together.

explain why he felt it so necessary to stress the point for the Maratha women at the court of Thanjavur. 
Tryambaka pursues the question of physical contact further in section IV. When Rāvana carries Sītā off by force, and therefore touches her, being unprotected (anīśā) she is not to blame. But when Hanuman offers to carry her to safety, she cannot bring herself to touch the body (gatram) of a man who is not her husband (Sdhp. 24r.5-7). Tryambaka then argues that when a priest at a śrauta ritual binds the sacrificer's wife with a girdle of kusa grass, his touch is that of a father (duhitrvat gurutvāt) and so does not pollute (Sdhp.24r.8-10). Similarly, although Sītā rejects the touch of Hanuman as that of another man, she assents to that of Agni (when she enters the fire to prove her innocence to Rama) because he is her father (the husband of Pṛthivi, the earth from which Sītā emerged; Sdhp.24r.10-24 v.6). However, since Ghatotkaca (Bhima's son by the rakṣasi, Hidimba) carried Draupadi (Ghatotkaca's step- mother), a woman may touch her (step-)son (Sdhp.24v.6-7). This concern to avoid physical contact with those outside one's im- mediate family is still in evidence today.33 
Midday rituals (Sdhp. 12v. 5–16v.7) 
In the fourth division of the traditional eightfold day, a man should take his midday bath; make a tarpana offering of water to gods, sages and ancestors; perform the midday samdhyā ritual; and worship the gods (Dakṣa II.43; Yajñ.I.100; Vidyarṇava 1979:1; PVK II.i.p.689; see above, pp. 44-9). With reference to women, Tryambaka mentions only the last of these (devapūjā; see below, pp. 178-80) and states that it is to be performed by the husband (bhartrā kriyamanadevapujāyām; Sdhp.12v.5-6) not the wife. 
In the fifth division of an eightfold day, before his midday meal, a man should perform the 'five great sacrifices' (pañcamahāyajñāḥ) 
33. In the exceptional cases where a man can talk freely with the wife of a colleague or neighbour, she will take care never to touch him even by mistake. If she offers him tea, she will put the cup down for him to pick up; for if she passed it to him directly, their hands might touch. In the less inhibited south, far more women travel about, going to work and so on. But this very freedom requires the special arrangement of segregated buses so that as far as possible women may avoid touching men.

comprising offerings to Brahman (brahmayajña; the study and teaching of the Veda; cf. Manu III. 70ff.; japa, Kull.), the gods (devayajña; homa, Kull.), the ancestors (pitṛyajña; tarpaṇa, Kull.), men (manuṣyayajña; atithipüjā, Kull.) and all beings (bhūtayajña; bali, Kull.). With reference to women, Tryambaka mentions only four rituals; and these do not correspond exactly with the pre- viously mentioned five. The vaiśvadeva ritual (see pp. 180-3) comprises offerings of cooked food to all gods and is said by some authorities to correspond to the devayajña, pitṛyajña and bhūtayajña (Sm.A.p.47; Par.M.I.i.p.389; Dakṣa II.56; cf. Gonda 1980:414–15). According to others, the requirements of these three are met by the vaiśvadeva and baliharana rituals together (e.g. Gov. on Baudh. II.6.11.4). Hospitality to guests (atithipüjä, see pp. 183-210), corresponds to manuṣyavajña. Balidāna, an offering to the goddess Jyesṭhā (see pp. 277-9), seems to be the wife's version of baliharana (bhūtayajña; cf. Gonda 1980:417ff.). Brahmayajña (consisting of Vedic study) is predictably not mentioned. 
Before describing the wife's role in these midday rituals, some- thing must be said about the obvious parallels and duplications evident in the various forms of worship. For, as Vedic sacrifice became rarer, alternative rituals developed alongside it, each carry- ing with it confusing echoes of the fire ritual. I have already discussed in some detail the śrauta fire sacrifice (agnihotra), its gṛhya counter- part (aupāsanahoma), and the twice- or thrice-daily samdhyā ritual (see pp. 102-7). The parallels and overlaps there are obvious. The substitution of the breaths for the sacred fires in prāṇāgni- hotra is yet another echo of Vedic sacrifice, as is the further develop- ment into the ritual offering of food (bhojanavidhi). 
Several of the rituals are performed twice a day: the homa offerings and twilight worship take place at sunrise and sunset; the ‘five great sacrifices', the vaiśvadeva ritual and bali offerings shortly before the midday and evening meals. If all or even some of these are observed, then there are inevitable duplications. To avoid this, Manu, for example, identifies homa with devayajña (Manu III.70, and Kull., Sarv.; Mit. on Yajñ.I.102). While admitting that others disagree, Haradatta identifies the vaisvadeva ritual with both devayajña and the domestic homa ritual (Har. on Ap.I.4.13.1; cf. Bodewitz 1976:191). Vidyarṇava, in his modern account of the midday duties required of the orthodox male, writes of the ‘Deva- 
 
178 
Strīdharmapaddhati 
yajña or the offering to fire, called also Homa, or Viśva offering' (1979:154). 
Image worship (devapüjā) seems at first to be subsumed in devayajña. For, although the term itself is of long standing (see Pāṇ.I.3.25), the earlier dharmasastra texts do not list it separately among the daily duties of the orthodox. Gaut.I.2.12.17, for example, mentions only the homa offering and samdhyā (cf. Āp.1.1.4.16–17; Baudh.I.2.3.19). Later smrtis, however, distinguish clearly between the two. Manu, for example, advocates image worship (devatā- bhyarcanam; hariharādidevapüjanam, Kull.) alongside offerings to gods, sages and ancestors (devarṣipitṛtarpanam) and the fire ritual (samidādhānam; samiddhomam, Kull.). According to some autho- rities, it should be performed after the morning homa (Sm.M.II. p.383, Marici) or after the midday observation of brahmayajña and tarpaṇa (Sm.M.II.p.383, Hārīta). According to Daksa II.30-1, all rituals for the gods (devakarya) should be performed in the first half of the day. By late medieval and modern times, however, devapüjā had almost totally replaced the earlier rituals from which it had evolved (cf. PVK II.ii.p. 705 ff.). 
Image worship (devapūjā; Sdhp.12v.5-8) 
Despite the vast medieval literature on the subject, Tryambaka tells us very little about the procedure of worship. Of the long list of actions advocated (upacāra; cf. Sm.C.II.p.532ff.; PVK II.ii. pp. 729 ff.), he names only naivedya, and that in his section on the preparation of food for the vaiśvadeva ritual (pp. 180-3). For Tryambaka is concerned solely with the wife's role and it is a sub- sidiary one. 
'When the devapuja is being performed by the husband, she (presumably the patni), without being told (to do so), should herself make ready all the items necessary for it.'34 Tryambaka's evidence for this statement is drawn from two slokas attributed here to Vyasa. The first of these (with the lines reversed and attributed to 'Skanda') has already been mentioned in section IIA (Sdhp. 4r.3-4; p.65). Both slokas reappear as part of a longer quotation (also attributed to 'Skanda') in the section on general behaviour (Sdhp.23r.7-9; p.273). They read as follows. 'She herself, with-

out being told (to do so), should make ready all the items for worship such as the water for the observances and the sacred grass, together with leaves, flowers, unbroken rice and so on. Without anxiety and with great joy, anticipating (each) moment, she should place everything near (her husband), (each item) at the appropriate time, '35 
The items specified may be related to the various stages of worship (upacāra). For example, fresh water (cf. Vis.Sm.66.1) is required for several procedures: for washing the feet of the image (pādya), for bathing it (snāna), for sipping (ācamana), and for the arghya offering. The sacred grass (barhis) forms a seat for the worshipper (see Vir.P.p.95 on äsanam). Various kinds of leaves are recommended for the worship of Siva, including those of the wood- apple (bilva), apāmārga and acacia (sami) trees, and the blue lotus (Vir.P.p.210). Basil (tulasi) leaves are offered to Visnu, either separately or when flowers are unavailable. They may also be mixed in the water used for bathing the images (Vir.P.p.42-9). Flowers of various kinds are offered in a separate upacara (puspa). The Visnusmrti prohibits the use of flowers that smell unpleasant or have no smell at all; white ones are allowed, if they smell nice; red ones, especially those that grow in water (jalajam; raktotpalam, Nand.) are best (Vis.Sm.66.5-9). For the worship of Śiva, arka, oleander (karavīra), drona, kuśa, datura (dhattūra) and acacia (samī) flowers are recommended, but the blue lotus is best (Vir.P. p. 210). Different flowers are listed for the worship of Visnu: various kinds of jasmine (vanamallikā, vāsantī, mālatī, kunda), magnolia (campaka) and aśoka flowers, and best of all the jātī jasmine (Vir. P.p.51). If the worshipper cannot afford the more expensive items required for certain upacaras (clothes, ornaments, unguents, etc.), he may use flowers instead. Flowers and unbroken rice are also added to the arghya offering of water, along with other items such as particular grasses, milk, curd, honey and so on (section IIB, p.151).

As described by Tryambaka, this is a classic example of the wife's role of assistant to her husband in religious rituals (dharma- patni). Strictly speaking, this is the case even in domestic image worship today. For while the wife or mother of an orthodox household may spend a large amount of time in the püjä room- perhaps offering various upacāras without mantras, or following the śüdra example of using puranic mantras instead-in orthodox terms, her worship is strictly devotional. For unless a woman has been initiated, has undergone the required Vedic education, has been taught the mantras and precisely what to say and do, she may not offer the full devapujä with Vedic mantras herself. Her husband or a priest must do it for her. In fact, in today's pūjā, the woman usually does everything except the crucial part of the ritual reserved for her husband; he does that, and then goes to the office. She may also touch her husband's arm during the ceremony in order to earn her share of his merit. For in effect, now as in Tryambaka's day, she can only assist. 
(The worship of) all gods (vaisvadeva; Sdhp.12v.8–13r.6). 
As explained briefly above (pp. 177-8), this offering of cooked food to all the gods before a meal is one of several modern rituals that con- tain echoes of early Vedic sacrifice. According to Sm.C.II.p.570, for example, it may be offered into either the ordinary or the srauta fire (laukike vaidike vā, although vaidike is immediately glossed as vaivāhike; cf. also Medh. on Manu V.7). Several authors maintain that the vaisvadeva ritual is identical with devayajña; others that it corresponds to pitṛyajña and bhūtayajña as well. In the Dharmākūta, Tryambaka agrees with this last view, quoting Vyasa and the Smṛtyarthasara (Dharmāk.III.p.78). In the Stri- dharmapaddhati, however, he does not add to this discussion. Once again, he is concerned only with the part the wife must play: she should prepare the food to be offered; she should be present at the ritual; and she should decorate the place of worship. 
‘After that (i.e. after the worship of the household images), she should do the cooking for the (offerings of food to) guests, all the gods, and so on. '36 The first quotation produced deals with the pre- paration of food for guests; I shall return to it in the section con- cerning the role of the wife in the atithipüjä (p, 198, note 64). The

second quotation, attributed to Vyasa, applies to the vaiśvadeva ritual. 'After taking her (ritual) bath, the senior wife (patni) should cook (food) in the home: (that) for the naivedya ritual (should be prepared) in a separate pot, and the delicacies (vyañjanāni) for the vaiśvadeva ritual separately in another.'37 
The distinction here is between one of the upacāras of devapūjā (see pp. 178-80), and the independent vaisvadeva ritual. Various rulings are given about naivedya offerings. According to Vis. Sm.66.12-14, one may not offer any food that is normally for- bidden, nor the milk of goats or buffaloes, nor the meat of five-toed animals, fish or wild boar. In general, however, the rule is the same for naivedya as it is for the vaiśvadeva ritual: one should offer to one's gods whatever food one eats oneself (Răm.II.102.30; 103.15; Medh. on Manu V.7). The Smrtyarthasara specifies that kṣāra, lavana and certain kinds of pulse should not be offered in the vaiśvadeva ritual (cf. Sm.C.II.p.574), thus recalling similar rulings relating to the fire ritual (see pp. 142-5). Tryambaka, however, tells us only that different pots should be used to cook the food intended for each ritual. 
The term vyanjanāni, used in the narrow sense, denotes any form of spice or seasoning. In its wider sense, as used here, it covers any good food cooked with appetising seasoning and condiments. This presumably indicates that food for the gods should be pre- pared with as much care as that for the family. 
Two more points should be made here. First, if naivedya is part of image worship (devapujā), then Tryambaka's sequence of events is wrong. The wife would have to prepare the naivedya offering before the ritual, not after it. 
Secondly, unlike the sweeping and cleaning of the home, the cooking of food is not an independent household task for which the wife is solely responsible. It is a subsidiary part of the midday rituals performed by her husband. The offering of food to the gods is the principal part (pradhāna); both the preparation beforehand and the eating afterwards are subsidiary (anga) to it. Thus, even in the realm of food, the wife may be seen to be acting as her husband's assistant in religion and not independently.

Strīdharmapaddhati 
Continuing this theme of the wife as religious assistant, Tryamba- ka explains that 'the patnī too should be present at the time of the vaiśvadeva ritual.'38 He quotes Nārāyaṇa. 'Bathed, ritually pure, accompanied by his wife, and without speaking, (a man) should sip (water) according to the injunction, sit down and, when the fire is lit, he should perform the vaiśvadeva ritual.'39 The quotation demonstrates that the male householder performs the ritual; all that is required of the wife at this stage is her presence. The question of the patni's presence at rituals is discussed in more detail with regard to the homa offerings (see above, pp.132-41). The overlap between homa, devayajña and vaiśvadeva suggests that the impli- cations here are the same. 
Tryambaka's final point in this subsection concerns the wife's role in decorating the place of worship. 'At the time of the vaiśva- deva ritual, the patnī should decorate with sandalwood paste and so on the places where food offerings (bali) are made.'40 He quotes Baudhāyana. 'Silently (tūṣṇīm; i.e. without the recitation of man- tras), the patni decorates all the places of worship (āyatanāni) with sandalwood paste, flowers, incense and lights.'41 
Several points may be noted here. The term tūṣṇīm recalls Baudhā- yana's orthodox views on women. For example, he admits that some people make funeral offerings when their married daughters die but argues that this is only done to placate the world (loka- samgrahaṇārtham), for women are held to be (without Vedic edu- cation and therefore) without mantras (tad amantrāḥ striyo matāḥ, Baudh.I.5.11.7; Manu IX.18). 
Secondly, both the term ayatanāni (cf. agnyāyatanam) and the wife's task of decorating the hearth recall the very similar rulings described in the section on agniśuśrūṣā (pp. 107-15). According to Tryambaka, decorating the hearth is the wife's sole responsi-

bility in the fire sacrifice; in the vaiśvadeva ritual, she does the cooking too. 
Finally, the references to sandalwood paste, flowers, incense and lights recall both the procedures of image worship (devapūjā), and the fact that it is the wife's job to gather together all the items required for religious worship (see above, pp.178-80). 
Paying homage to guests (atithipūjā; Sdhp. 13r.6-16v.7) As mentioned above (pp.176-8), paying homage to guests by offering hospitality corresponds to manusyayajña, one of the 'five great sacrificés' of the householder's day. Since the wife is instru- mental in the observation of this ritual-both preparing the food and serving it on her husband's behalf- this section is a lengthy one. Tryambaka begins with some general rules concerning the timing of the ritual and the form it should take. 
'At the end of the vaiśvadeva ritual, if a guest has come, homage should be paid to him.'42 Tryambaka quotes Āpastamba. 'The two owners (of the house, svāmin[au]; i.e. pati and patni) should not refuse anyone who asks for food at the (appropriate) time (kāle). If there is no (food), then (one should offer him) a place to sit (bhumi[h]; lit. 'ground'), water, grass (or straw, tṛṇāni; i.e. to sit on) and a kind word (kalyāṇī vāg); these things never disappear in the house of a good man. Those two (i.e. the husband and wife) who be- have in this way go to the eternal world.'43 
Kāle is glossed by Haradatta as 'after the vaiśvadeva ritual' (Ujj.; cf. Mit. on Yājñ.I.107). In a similar śloka from Manu, bhūmi means 'a pleasant place to sit or sleep' (āsanaśayanaviharasthānam; Medh. on Manu III.101); ‘grass' means a couch or bed (śrastara, Medh.; sayaniya, Kull.). According to Nandana, grass should be offered if no (proper, i.e. wooden) seat is available (āsanābhāve); an area of ground if there is no bed (bhūmiḥ śayanābhāve). The

water is for such things as washing the guest's feet (pädaprakṣā- lanādyarthajala°; Kull.); according to Nandana, if there are no unguents with which to massage them (pādābhyañjanābhāve). Manu's 'friendly speech' (sūnṛtā) is explained by Medhātithi as that which is both pleasant and salutary (priyahitavacanam). Nandana's gloss quotes Apastamba (kalyāṇī vāg) and adds that this is ap- propriate if there is no food (annābhāve). 
To avoid repetition, I include at this point a similar general statement regarding timing and format, taken from Manu, but given by Tryambaka somewhat later in this section. 'After per- forming the bali offering in this way, one should first (pūrvam) feed the guest. According to the injunction (vidhipurvakam), one should offer any guest who has come (to one's house) a seat (āsano°) and water, and food too, according to one's resources, and making it as wholesome (satkṛtya) as one can.'44 
'First' here means before one takes one's own meal (purvam ätmanah, Sarv. on Manu III.94; pūrvam svabhojanāt, Rāgh.). 'According to the injunction' is glossed by Sarvajñanārāyaṇa as 'according to the religious law pertaining to guests declared by Apastamba' (Sarv. on Manu III.99). ‘Seat' (āsana) means not just any place to sit but the low wooden seat, a few inches off the ground (so that one may comfortably sit cross-legged), that is traditionally offered to important people or guests (cf. pitha, Sdhp.40v.10; pīṭhanam āsanam, Amar.II.6.3.40). Satkṛtya may be taken in two ways. In Manu III.96, for example, Medhātithi and Govindarāja take it to mean 'paying homage' (püjayitvā, Medh.; phalapuspādinā, Gov.). However, Kulluka and Raghavananda on Manų III.99 take it with annam to indicate the appropriate attention given to pre- paring the guest's food (vyañjanādibhiḥ satkṛtam cănnam, Kull.; vyañjanaiḥ samskṛtya, Rāgh.; cf. Kull. on Manu III.96). Because of the associations with the food offered in the vaiśvadeva ritual (cf. vyañjanāni, note 37). I have preferred the latter interpretation. 
On these general points of timing and importance, a few obser- vations may be made. For example, Tryambaka makes no mention of the bali offering (balikarman) that according to Manu should precede the ritual of feeding the guest. I shall return to this point

when I deal with the wife's bali offering to the goddess Jyesthā (balidānam; see below, pp. 227–9). 
The role of the wife is not at this point spelled out. Apastamba uses the dual form 'the two owners' (svāminau), indicating that the responsibility for the ritual is shared jointly by husband and wife. This is a faint echo of the 'two sacrificers' of Vedic times, the ideal of the married couple participating jointly in their religious obli- gations. If they behave as they should, both are rewarded in heaven. In contrast, Manu's rulings are couched in the masculine, without reference to the wife even in the dual form. Although it is clearly assumed that the wife must take care of the practical aspects of feeding the guest (see Manu III.103, and below, pp. 198-9), the responsibility for the ritual rests on the husband. The good wife who plays her part is thus participating in her husband's religious duty (prativratabhägini) rather than her own. 
Tryambaka's second point is to stress 'the necessity (āvaśyakatvam) of offering homage to the guest'. The same point is made, in other contexts, elsewhere in the treatise. In Tryambaka's conclusion, for example, offering hospitality to the guest is the underlying theme in several of the lengthy stories told: in the story of the pigeons and the bird-catcher, the male pigeon offers his own body as food (section V, pp. 306- 7; in the story of Kausika, the ascetic's anger is caused by the lack of hospitality shown to him (section V, pp.308- 9); in the story of Sudarsana—according to whom, offering hospitality to the guest is the householder's supreme religious duty - his wife, Oghavati, is required to offer her body to the brahmin guest, and Death is conquered thereby (section V, pp. 310-12). In this section, however, Tryambaka draws upon the story of Naciketas in the Kathopaniṣad.45 This Upanisad is generally assigned to the Kathaka school of the Black Yajurveda. The same story appears in Tait.Br.III.11.8.1 ff. and, in a variety of forms, in both epic and purāna literature (e.g. Mbh.XIII.70; Var.P.p.194ff., 1103 ff.). 
Tryambaka begins with a prose recapitulation of the story to pro- vide the framework for the important quotations from the Kathopa- niṣad. This prose version, together with the three verses and the final prose comment enclosing them, reads as if it has all been taken from 
45. atithipüjanasyāvasyakatvam kathavalДyam api / Sdhp.13r.9.

Stridharmapaddhati 
some work such as Tryambaka's own Dharmākūta. Alternatively, the prose passages may be original to this treatise. The recapitula- 
tion runs as follows. 
'(Naciketas' father gave) as the fee (to the priests) for a sacri- fice he had begun, cows that had (already) drunk their (share of) water, eaten their (share of) grass and given their (share of) milk, and which no longer had any strength (i.e. to reproduce; apra- jananasamarthāḥ, Sankara, Dh.kosa II.iii.p.1389). Because of this fault in the sacrificial fee, i.e. in his (father's) gift of cows, Naciketas believed that his father would go to a world without joy (when he died). So, in order to remove that (fault), he asked his father again and again: "To which particular priest will you give me?" In anger, his father replied: "I shall give you to Death!" Because of the authority of his (father's) words, and because he believed that obeying the command of one's father is the most important religious law, he (Naciketas) went to the house of Yama. Since Yama was away, he stayed there for three days (lit. “nights”) without receiving the honour (due to a guest). Then, when Yama had completed his journey and returned, his ministers said to him...

Tryambaka then quotes the first of the three verses from the Kathopaniṣad. (Like) fire (vaiśvānaraḥ), the brahmin guest enters homes; they (i.e. good householders) pacify him (sāntim kurvanti) with this (hospitality): "Fetch water, O Vaivasvata (Yama)!”’'47 Sankara glosses vaiśvānarah as 'like a burning fire' (agnir eva ... dahann iva; Dh.kosa II.iii.p.1390; cf. Āp.II.3.6.3). The idea of ‘pacifying' him (śāntim kurvantí) relates both to the proper treat- ment of the guest and to the image of fire. Just as one needs to

‘quench' a fire (dāham śamayanta iva; Śankara), so one must ‘ap- pease' the guest by offering water to wash his feet, a seat and so on (etām pādyāsanādidānalakṣaṇām... santo 'tithir; Sankara, Dh.kosa II.iii.p.1390). Hence the summons to bring water to wash Naciketas' feet. The implication is clear: a guest not honoured in this way will destroy that household like a raging fire. 
The second verse quoted continues this theme. ‘If a brahmin (guest) stays without eating in the house of (such) a foolish man, then hope and expectation, friendship and good fellowship, sacri- fice and charitable works, sons and cattle-all these he snatches away (from the negligent host). '48 
Although some dharmaśāstra texts enjoin that anyone who asks for food at the right time should be treated with the honour due to the guest (including kṣatriyas, vaisyas and sūdras, according to Baudh.II.3.5.11), it is often assumed-as it is here- that the proper recipient of such homage is the brahmin. According to Manu III. 110, for example, neither a kṣatriya, a vaiśya nor a sūdra should be welcomed in this way in a brahmin house. Gautama is equally specific: only a brahmin may be a ‘guest' to a brahmin (brāhmaṇasyā- nathithir abrāhmaṇaḥ; Gaut.I.5.39). Visitors of lower varṇa should be given food (Baudh.II.3.5.14 suggests that the sudra should work for his) and treated kindly, but they do not merit the homage due to the brahmin guest (e.g. Manu III.111-12). It is thus because Naciketas is a brahmin that Yama is so anxious to make amends. Equally, it is because Rāvana is disguised as a brahmin that Sītā is right to do him honour. The story of Draupadi and King Jaya- dratha, on the other hand, demonstrates that kṣatriyas are entitled to such homage when they come to a kṣatriya household (see above, pp.170-6, and below, pp.199–203). 
The third verse presents Yama's reply. He begins by admitting that Naciketas is indeed the kind of visitor who is entitled to be called a ‘guest', and honoured accordingly. 'O brahmin, since you —a guest worthy of honour (namasyaḥ; namaskārārhaḥ, Sankara, Dh.kośa II.iii.p.1391)—have stayed in my house for three days (lit. "nights”) without eating, choose in return therefore three wishes.

Strīdharmapaddhati 
I bow to you, O brahmin. May all go well with me!'49 Sankara explains that each (day and) night that Naciketas has been neglected merits a wish in return (rātrim prati trīn varān; Śankara, Dh.kośa II.iii.p.1391). Tryambaka's closing comment agrees. 'Appeasing (Naciketas) in this way, he (Yama) presented him with three wishes to remove the sin of having had him stay in his house without eating for three days.'50 
This leads Tryambaka to his third point: the severe punishment in store for those who neglect the laws of hospitality. He begins with a quotation attributed to the Vedic school of Pārakṣudra (pāra- kṣudraśākhāyām). The text of this name, cited in the Apastamba- śrautasūtra (MW:620), seems to be no longer extant. It was pro- bably part of the tradition of the Apastamba school of the Black Yajurveda, to which Tryambaka himself almost certainly belonged (see p.25). The sutras themselves, however, are found elsewhere: in the Taittiriyabrāhmaṇa and the Taittiriyopaniṣad. The quotation runs as follows. 'He who gives me, that man surely encloses (āvāḥ) me. I, who am food, eat the eater of food. Even before the fire, food burns.'51 
In the context of the Upanisad, this is the ecstatic chant of the enlightened man for whom the dualities of the phenomenal world are all at once transcended (cf. Śankara on Tait.Up.III.10; Dh. kośa II.ii.pp.740-2). In the context of the Brahmana (according to Sāyaṇa), and very probably in that of the Pārakṣudra too, the lord of food (annasvāmin; Sāy.) himself is talking, the god of the eternal law, that is, of sacrifice (rtasya yajñasya; Say.). According to Sāyaṇa's interpretation, if a man who has faith (yaḥ śraddhaluḥ pumān) gives away to brahmins and so on (brāhmaṇādibhyah prayacchati) me in the form of food (mām annarūpam), then he (sa dātā) encloses (āvāḥ āvṛṇoti) me the god of food (mām anna-

devam), thus making me his own (svikaroti). But if a man, without giving me away (mām adattvā), himself eats (svayam eva atti)- then I, the god of food, eat him (tam... annadevo 'ham admi); that is, I cause him to be utterly destroyed (tam vināśayāmi; Sāy. on Tait.Br., Dh.kośa II.i.p.477-8). Sankara, commenting on the Upaniṣad, glosses āvāḥ as 'he protects' (avati). According to Sāyaṇa, the fire of the stomach (udarāgniḥ) 'burns' or digests (dahati pācayati) the food that is eaten for only a day. But the man who eats without giving (adātā tu bhoktā) burns then and there (tadānīm eva dahyate) from the food he is eating (bhujyamānenännena). 'Before the fire' means 'before the cremation fire', that is, in this world. For the sin of not feeding others, which is enough to send a man to hell, arises at that very moment (narakahetoḥ pratyavāyasya tadaivotpannatvāt). The image of the cremation fire serves both as an analogy for the sinner's internal burning in this life and as a reminder of the hell- fires to come. 
This theme of the punishment threatened by the god of food is continued in Tryambaka's next quotation, taken this time from dharmasastra. Baudh.II.3.5.17 rules that one should never eat without first giving away some food. Verse 18 quotes two ślokas voiced by the god of food (annagītau ślokau). These two slokas, attributed to Baudhāyana, are now presented by Tryambaka. 
'Whoever eats me- that is, food that has been prepared-with- out giving any to his ancestors, gods, servants, guests and friends, out of delusion, he eats poison: I shall eat him; and I shall be his death. But whoever (first) offers the agnihotra sacrifice, performs the vaiśvadeva ritual, pays homage to his guests, and (only) then contented, pure and having faith-eats me, i.e. what is left after feeding the servants, then for him I become nectar and he enjoys me.52 
The earlier threat of internal fires has been replaced by that of death by poison. Both reinforce the rules of hospitality to the guest with powerful magical implications. If the householder behaves as 
52. bodhāyano 'pi yo mam adatvä pitṛdevatābhyo bhṛtyätithīnām ca suhrjjanasya / sampannam aśnan viṣam atti mohāt tam admy aham tasya ca mṛtyur asmi // hutāgnihotraḥ kṛtavaiśvade vaḥ püjyātithĩn bhṛtyajanāvašiṣṭam // tustah sucih sraddadhad atti yo mam tasyāmṛtam syām sa ca mām bhunakti ¡¡ iti // Sdhp.14r.1-4 (atīthin amended to atithin; vasistam to vasistam; Baudh.) <Baudh.II.3.5.18; Sm.C.II.p.409 (bhrtyatithibhyas for bhṛtyātithīnām; suhrj- janaya for suhrjjanasya; api for admy).

Strīdharmapaddhati 
he ought, the food is transformed into nectar and digests easily. If he does not, it changes within his body and--as either fire or poison-destroys him. For, as Baudhāyana quotes elsewhere, food is life (annam prāṇam iti; cf. Tait.Br.II.8.8.3) and therefore must be given; it is the highest offering (paramam haviḥ) one can make (Baudh.II.3.6.41). 
Before considering the next quotation given by Tryambaka (Sdhp.14r.4-14v.1; see below, note 63), I shall take out of sequence a number of quotations relating to the threats of punishment in store for those who neglect the laws of hospitality. The first two slokas belong to the same passage attributed to Manu (Sdhp. 14v.1-6) from which an earlier out-of-sequence quotation was taken (Sdhp.14v.1-3; note 44). The remaining quotations on this topic are drawn from a passage attributed to the Asvamedhikaparvan of the Mahābhārata (Sdhp. 14v.6-15r.1). 
According to the Manu quotations, the danger stems not from the magical properties of food, nor from the vengeful nature of the god of food, but from the supernatural powers of the guest himself. Thus, ‘if a guest leaves one's house with his hopes (for food) dashed, he bequeathes his sins (to his host) and takes away his (host's) merit.'53 Or again, ‘if a brahmin stays without being (duly) hon- oured, he deprives (his host) of all his good deeds, even if he (i.e. his host, is the kind of brahmin who) gathers (food) by gleaning and who always offers oblations in five fires.'54 
The assumption here, as earlier, is that the guest in question is a brahmin. Although ‘guests' or visitors of other varņas may be given

food and so on, it seems that the curse of the brahmin guest is what is really feared. It is this fear that constrains Sītā when she is con- fronted by Ravana disguised as a brahmin renouncer. Since he is a guest and a brahmin (brāhmaṇas cătithiś cāyam), Sītā reasons, he has the power to curse her if ignored (anukto hi sapeta mām; Rām. III.47.2). So she offers him homage and hospitality as she ought. Tryambaka returns to this episode below (pp.200–1). 
But the power of the guest is not merely that of the brahmin. For even the most superior brahmin will lose all his accumulated merit to a slighted guest. Manu IV.4-5 defines the five means of subsistence open to brahmins in an ideal world. The highest, termed 'truth' (ṛtam), is gleaning corn (unchaśilam); the next, termed 'nectar' (amṛtam), is receiving what is given unasked (ayācitam); the third, termed 'death' (mṛtam), is obtaining food by begging (vācitam); the fourth, termed 'death-causing' (pramṛtam; cf. Manu X.83), is agriculture (karṣaṇam); and the fifth and lowest, termed 'truth mixed with untruth' (satyānṛtam), is trade (vāṇijyam). In Manu's utopian world, even the first three methods of subsistence may be pursued by brahmins in the householder stage, men who have spent a quarter of their lives at the feet of a teacher (cf. Manu IV.1) and who have then deliberately sought out a way of life that will cause as little pain as possible to other beings (adrohenaiva bhūtā- nām alpadroheṇa vā; Manu IV.2). At the top of the hierarchy is the man who stores no food at all but gathers each day what he needs from 'permitted places' (aväritasthāneṣu; Baudh.III.2.14). 
But the householder brahmin described here (by both Manu and Tryambaka) is not only one of these. He also offers his morning oblations in five fires: that is, in the aupasana or gṛhya fire used for domestic rituals; in the three srauta fires; and in the sabhya fire kept for general warmth (Mit. on Yajñ.I.221; Har. on Gaut.II. 6.29; Medh. on Manu III.185). Such exemplary brahmins are in- cluded among those whose presence at a meal is held to bless the household (panktipāvana; cf. Gaut.II.6.29; Āp.II.7.17.22; Manu III.185; Yājñ.1.221). Manu's point (and Tryambaka's) is that even so austere a brahmin householder, who has accumulated vast reserves of merit and ascetic power, loses all that merit if he fails to welcome a brahmin guest as he should. 
Tryambaka pursues this theme still further in several slokas attributed to the Asvamedhikaparvan. They describe two kinds of 
192 
Stridharmapaddhati 
eminent householders who, by virtue of their highly meritorious practices, might be considered immune to the dangers of not wel- coming a guest. In each case, neglect of the guest renders all their previous activities useless. 
'If a twice-born recites the vedas, the vedängas and the upāngas each day, but does not pay homage to the guest, he recites in vain. Those who perform the (domestic) sacrifices with cooked food offerings (päkayajña), the (five) great sacrifices, and the (seven) basic forms (samstha) of the soma sacrifice, and (yet) do not honour the guest who has come to their home, then, though they desire fame and wealth, all that they have given away or offered in the sacrifice is rendered vain, killed by (their guest's) killed hope. '55 For 'he who does not pay homage at the end of the vaisvadeva ritual to any guest who has come, at once becomes an outcaste (candāla); there is no doubt about that.'56 
Pākayajña is defined in the gṛhyasūtras as a domestic sacrifice with cooked offerings (grhyasthālīpāka; Pār.gṛ.I.1.1.). The term is used to distinguish domestic rituals from both srauta and soma sacrifices (e.g. Śānkh.gr.I.1.15; Manu II.143; Gaut.I.8.19–21). According to some authorities, they are of three kinds (e.g. Nār. on Aśv.gr.1.1.2); according to others, four (e.g. Šānkh.gṛ.I.5.1; Pār.gr.I.4.1; Manu II.8.6; Vas.26.10; cf. Gonda 1980:186); ac- cording to others again, in line with śrauta and soma rituals, seven (e.g. Gaut.I.8.19-21). The term used for these seven 'basic forms' of the päkayajña, haviryajña and soma rituals is samsthaḥ (see above).

Day 
193 
The threat in the last sloka that the householder neglectful of his guest will 'at once' (sadya eva) become a caṇḍāla refers to a 'visible' (drsta) not an otherwordly (adrṣṭa) result (see p.58). That man need not wait to be reborn as a candāla in his next life; he will at once be judged by others to be one. This recalls the point made by Sāyaṇa in his comment on the Taittirīyabrāhmaṇa quotation above (note 51). The 'visible' result of the man who eats without feeding others is that the food burns him then and there (tadānīm eva); he need not wait for the burning of the cremation fire or the flames of hell (Say. on Tait. Br., Dh.kośa II.1.p.477-8). 
A final observation should be made concerning these punish- ments. Every ruling given by Tryambaka so far has been couched in the masculine, many of them involving terms that cannot be applied (by the modification of gender) to women. I have already discussed the implications of the term dvija (initiation, Vedic education, etc.): by the definition of Tryambaka's day, these can- not apply to women (see pp.34-9). The same can be said of all the other specific terms describing the householder host: 'the performer of the agnihotra ritual' (hutägnihotraḥ); 'the performer of the vaiśvadeva ritual' (kṛtavaiśvadevah); 'the man who offers oblations in five fires' (pañcāgnin ... juhvataḥ); the reciter of the vedas, angas and upāngas; the performer of domestic rituals, the five 'great sacrifices' and soma rituals; and so on. Judging from these rulings, we may conclude that the responsibility for the honouring of guests remains that of the male householder, and that the punish- ments described will be inflicted on him. We may also assume, however, that the householder's wife, being his assistant in ritual matters, would be considered an accessory to her husband's crime, and punished accordingly. 
The last sloka in the group attributed to the Aśvamedhikaparvan turns from the penalties incurred by inhospitality to the rewards in store for the householder who duly honours his guests. In this section, therefore, I have gathered together the quotations relating to this topic. Apart from the sloka attributed to Manu-which belongs to the same passage referred to earlier (Sdhp.14v.1-6; note 44)--all the quotations are taken in sequence, beginning with the final sloka in the Asvamedhaparvan group. 
'Whatever one does not offer (lit. "feed") to the guest, one should 
 
194 
Stridharmapaddhati 
not eat oneself: paying homage to the guest (in this way) brings one wealth, fame, long life and heaven.'57 This ruling recalls Kullūka's interpretation of satkṛtya in Manu III.99: one should take the same care with seasoning, sauces, condiments and so on in relation to the guest's food as one does to one's own (vyañjanādibhiḥ sat- kṛtam cānnam, Kull.; see pp. 183-4). Since the wife is responsible for the cooking, this is in effect a ruling for her. 
According to a sloka attributed to Sātātapa, the highest heaven is reserved for the householder who honours guests. 'For the house- holder cannot by means of either (Vedic) study, (performing) the agnikotra oblation, (offering) sacrifice, or (performing) austerities attain those (heavenly) worlds that are (his simply) as a result of honouring the guest.'58 A similar comparison is made in the sloka attributed earlier to Manu. "That meritorious reward which one obtains by offering oblations in the fire according to the injunction —just like that, or even better, is the reward (obtained) when the brahmin (guest) is given satisfaction.'59 A śloka taken from Bhisma's eulogy of guest-worship in the Anusasanaparvan of the Mahabharata agrees. 'When a guest is honoured, whatever good he conceives in his mind (concerning his host) cannot be equalled by a hundred sacri- fices, so men say.'60 We may again note that the references to Vedic study, sacrifices and so on indicate that the recipient of the reward is assumed to be the male householder. Presumably the devoted wife would be allowed to join her husband in the highest heaven. For she is said to be 'half her husband's body' (sarīrārdham smṛtā) and thus participates equally in both his merit and his

There follows a series of slokas on the same subject, all attributed to the conversation between Tärkṣya and Sarasvati in the Āranyaka- parvan of the Mahābhārata (Mbh.III.184.1-25). In the critical edition of the Mahabharata, however, all the slokas are in fact to be found in the appendix to Mbh.III. 'The superior brahmin (lit. "best of twice-born") gives (food) to guests, beings and ancestors and (then) eats the dishes that remain (śiṣṭāny annāni) — what could be better than that? O Indra, there is nothing in the world more wholesome than this: that a man always gives food to guests and then eats of that (which is left). However many morsels of food a twice-born (guest) eats each day, the giver (host) receives the reward of (giving) that many thousands of cows (as sacrificial fee to the priests).'61 'O excellent Bharata, the reward (obtained) by washing the feet of a learned brahmin (guest) is (equal to) that obtained by giving a reddish-brown cow (cf. Yājñ.I.205) at Jyeṣṭhā lake (a sacred tīrtha; cf. PVK IV.p.759). As long as the ground remains wet from the water (used) for (washing) the feet of the twice-born, the ancestors will drink water from a lotus petal (cup). Welcoming (a guest) pleases the (three śrauta) fires; (offering) a seat (pleases) Indra; washing the feet (pleases) the ancestors; (offering) food (pleases) Prajapati.'62 
The emphasis on the idea that one should offer food to the guest and then eat what he leaves is a deliberate analogy with the sacrifice. As Tryambaka explains earlier, with regard to his quotation from the Kathopaniṣad (Sdhp.13v.5<Kath. Up.I.7; see above, pp.185-8),

the guest is like fire. Like the sacrificial fire, he consumes the offering. What is left, like prasada, is blessed. According to Manu III.285, one should eat both the residue of the offering to guests (vighasobhuktaśeṣam) and that of the sacrifice (vajñaśeṣam... amṛtam) every day. For in both 'sacrifices', food is magically transformed into nectar. A similar idea is to be found in the ruling that a pupil should first offer his alms-food to his teacher and then eat what is left: in this case, the teacher is the deity, the alms-food the sacrificial offering (bhaikṣam haviṣā) and the teacher's stomach the ahavaniya fire (Ap.I.1.3.43-1.1.4.2). Similarly, at meal-times, the wife should offer cooked food to her husband and then eat what he leaves. I shall return to this point below (see ucchista, pp. 221-7). 
Tryambaka himself develops this parallel between the fire sacrifice and the homage one should pay to guests. I return here to the original sequence of the treatise followed until half-way through section IIC (see p. 190). Tryambaka quotes at length from 'the Brahmana quoted by Apastamba' (āpastambodährtabrāhmaṇam api; that is, Ap.II.3.7.1–11). 
Apastamba frequently cites the Brāhmaṇas; more often than not with the phrase iti hi brāhmaṇam (e.g. Āp.I.1.1.10,11; I.1.3.9; I.1.3.26, see below; I.2.7.7,11; athāpi brāhmaṇam, I.3.10.8). In this particular case, the phrase is given in a separate sutra and interpreted by Haradatta as referring to each of the preceding sutras 1-10 (iti brähmaṇam ity asya sarvena sambandhaḥ; Ujj. on Ap. II.3.7.11). Since sutra 5 is also a quotation (... iti vijñāyate), Haradatta may have thought it necessary to stipulate that the Brahmana quotation includes sūtras 1 to 5 as well as 6 to 10. Unfortunately, Bühler has been seriously misled by the comment. In his translation of sūtra 11, he takes brahmanam to mean 'brahmin' (masc. acc.) instead of 'Brähmana text' (neut. nom.). He notes that nine of the thirteen manuscripts used for his edition read iti brāhmaṇam instead of iti hi brāhmaṇam (Āp., Bühler edn., p.64, footnote); and that Haradatta has also dropped the hi. (In the Benares edition, the hi is dropped from both the sutra and the commentary.) The resulting loss of the usual formula for citing the Brāhmaṇa seems to have encouraged Bühler to interpret the phrase otherwise. He translates. "Thus (a Brāhmaṇa shall treat) a Brahmana (and a Kshatriya and a Vaisya their caste-fellows).' He has evidently taken Haradatta's sarvena 
Day 
197 
sambandhaḥ to mean 'referring to each person' instead of 'referring to each sūtra'. To make sense of this translation, we must assume the verb and general construction of sūtras 12 (räjänam ced atithir abhyagacchet...) and 13 (ähitägnim ced atithir abhyagacchet...). According to Bühler's interpretation, therefore, we have a threefold distinction: the behaviour of a brahmin (sūtras 1-11); that of a king (sūtra 12); and that of an agnihotrin (sūtra 13). 
But this is both unnecessary and wrong. For one thing, the agni- hotrin is a brahmin. For another, unlike sūtras 12 and 13, the preced- ing group does not in fact describe the behaviour of the host at all. As Tryambaka's extract demonstrates, sutras 1-11 spell out the symbolic correspondences in operation during the ritual of atithi- püjā, whoever is acting as host. Sūtras 12 and 13 distinguish between the two most likely categories of host: the kṣatriya, exemplified here by the king (räjäbhiṣiktah kṣatriyo 'sav ..; Ujj.); and the brahmin, exemplified here by the agnihotrin. A further problem with Bühler's interpretation is his translation of brähmanam to include not only the brahmin guest but the kṣatriya and vaisya as well. For while the term dvija ('twice-born') often denotes the brahmin alone (e.g. Rām.III.46.32b-35 < Sdhp.15v.3-8; see note 69 below), the term brāhmaṇa never denotes all the twice-born 
varnas. 
The passage reads as follows. 'That same (homage to guests; or "sacrifice to men”, manuṣyayajñaḥ, Ujj.) is a (śrauta) sacrifice eternally performed by the householder to Prajapati. The fire of the guest (his digestive fire; jatharo 'gnih, Ujj.) is the ähavanīya fire. The fire in the household (the domestic fire; grhe 'gnir aupāsanaḥ, Ujj.) is the garhapatya fire. The fire in which the cooking is done (the ordinary fire; laukikāgniḥ, Ujj.) is the fire for cooking the sacri- ficial offering (the dakṣinagni, Ujj.). If a man eats before his guest (has eaten), then he devours (destroys) the nourishment, pros- perity, offspring, cattle, sacrifices and good works of the household. Food that is mixed with milk (paya upasecanam yasya tad annam; Ujj.) (and offered to the guest) corresponds to the agnistoma sacri- fice; that mixed with ghee to the ukthya sacrifice; that mixed with honey to the atirātra sacrifice; that mixed with meat to the dvadasa sacrifice; that mixed with water brings fame and an increase in progeny. It is recognized (by the authorities) that both the guests one likes and those one dislikes enable one to go to the heavenly world. When one gives (food to guests) in the morning, at midday, 
 
198 
Stridharmapaddhati 
and in the evening, these (three rituals) become the (three) pressings of soma. When one rises after (the guest himself has risen to go; yad gantum uttiṣṭham anutisthati, Ujj.), that is the ritual of leaving the place of sacrifice. When one addresses (the guest) kindly, (i.e. when one performs the ritual of) praise, that is the sacrificial fee. When one takes one's leave (of a guest; i.e. follows him out as a mark of respect; anuvrajanam, Ujj.), his steps are the visnukramāḥ (the steps taken by the sacrificer between the altar and the ahavanīya fire). When one comes back (into the house afterwards), that is the purificatory bath (marking the end of the sacrifice). Thus declares the Brähmaṇa text.' 
All the rituals named are types of soma sacrifice. I have discussed above how frequently echoes of Vedic sacrifice reappear in later rituals (see pp.102-7, pp.176-8). In this example, as in that of the internalization of the sacrifice (prānāgnihotra), those echoes are deliberately sought and stressed. The purpose, and the result, is to bestow on the ritual homage to the guest the grandeur, sanctity and authority of Vedic sacrifice. By extension, therefore, the role of the wife in this apparently domestic ritual is raised to the level of the dharmapatni in the śrauta sacrifice. As we have seen, no higher religious office is open to her. 
This brings us to the central issue under discussion: the role of the wife in the ritual homage to the guest. 
I shall begin with a point raised by Tryambaka considerably earlier, in the context of the vais vadeva ritual (see pp.180-3). For it is the wife's duty 'to prepare the food for the vaisvadeva ritual, for the homage to guests and so on.'64 Tryambaka's evidence

for this ruling-given in his section on the vaiśvadeva ritual but, for reasons of consistency, dealt with here-is taken from the chapter in the Visnupurana describing the conversation between the seer, Ṛbhu, and his pupil, Nidāgha (ṛbhunidāghasamvāda). When Rbhu comes to Nidāgha's house as a guest, Nidāgha instructs his wife, Śālinī, as follows. ““O Śālinī, using all the most exquisite delicacies to be found in my house, prepare food for him." Instructed in this way by him (Nidāgha), his wife prepared that food which is (considered) wholesome (i.e. acceptable) for a brahmin (lit. “twice- born"); (and she did this) because of the authority of a husband's command.'65 
Several points already raised may be reaffirmed here. The term patnī reinforces the parallel with the Vedic sacrifice and the im- portance of the wife's role as sacrificer's assistant (section IIB, pp. 107-15). The instruction detailing the culinary preparations recalls Kulluka's ruling concerning the care that should be taken with the guest's food (see pp.183–5), and the fact that one should not eat oneself what one does not offer the guest (see pp.193–6). Finally, although the wife is responsible for the actual preparation of the food, the reference to her husband's 'command' indicates under whose authority she functions. This in turn recalls earlier pronouncements concerning punishments and rewards consequent upon this ritual: the ultimate responsibility rests with him (see pp.185-8, 193-6). 
Returning to Tryambaka's section on atithipüjā, and back in sequence once more, the next point concerns the presence of the wife. When the husband is present, it is his responsibility; when he is absent, his wife should act on his behalf. As Tryambaka explains, 'if the husband has gone away, any guest who comes (to the house) should be honoured by his wife (patnī) instead. '66 '(This is so) because it has been established that the presence of a wife in the house is necessary for the (offering of) food to a guest, as is indicated in Manu's statement that "one should recognize (as a guest) one

who has come to a house where there is both a wife and the (three) fires."'67 
In fact, the half-sloka quoted here by Tryambaka (Manu III.103b) must be taken together with Manu III.102 and 103a to make com- plete sense. Verse 102 defines the term 'guest' (atithi): a brahmin who stays for one night (ekarātram tu nivasan ... brāhmaṇaḥ). Verse 103 expands upon this. One should not recognize (na, III.103a; vidyāt, III.103b) the following people as guests: a brahmin who lives in the same village, or one who is making a social or business call (naikagrāmīnam atithim vipram sāmgatikam tathā; III. 103a), even if he has come to a house where there is a wife and the sacred fires (III.103b). The implication of the half-sloka is now clear: the house in which the guest may be properly honoured is that of the agnihotrin in which the three śrauta fires are worshipped; and in which the (chief) wife is present. This recalls the very similar rulings concerning the importance of the patnī at the fire ritual. There as here, the husband may be absent but not the wife (see section IIB, pp. 132-41). 
Tryambaka draws his evidence for this ruling from the two episodes cited earlier in relation to whether or not the good wife should talk to a man who is not related to her (see pp.170–6): Sita's meeting with Rāvaṇa, and Draupadi's with Jayadratha. He begins with the first incident. As he explains, 'it is because of this (ruling; ata eva) that it is said in the Ramayana that Sītā paid homage to Rāvana when he came to her in the guise of a brahmin, even though Rāma was away (at the time). '68 The quotation reads as follows. 
'Now when she saw Rāvana, who had come in the guise of a brahmin, Maithili (Sītā) honoured him with all the attentions (traditionally enjoined) for a guest. First, she brought him a seat (āsana; usually a low wooden seat, see pp.183-4; but see also bṛsī below) and invited him (to sit) with (the offer of) water to wash his feet. Then she said to that seemingly gentle man, "It is ready." Seeing that he had come in the guise of a twice-born, that he 67. upasthitam grhe vidyad bhārya yatrāgnayo 'pi va (Sdhp.15v.1, Manu < Manu III.103b) iti manuvacanenātithibhojanasya gṛhe bhāryasatve niyatatva- pratipädanād iti // Sdhp.15v.1-2.

was carrying an alms-bowl and water-pot, and that it was impos- sible to find a way of avoiding him, the woman Maithili invited him as (one usually invites) a brahmin. "Here is a cushion (bṛsi), O brahmin: sit if you will. And here is water for washing your feet: please accept it. And here, prepared (especially) for you, is the best forest produce: may you eat here undisturbed." '67 
Two things persuade Sītā to treat Rāvana as she would an honoured guest. First, he looks like a brahmin. The term 'twice- born' (dvija, dvijāti) is repeatedly assumed here to be synonymous with ‘brahmin' (brähmaṇavat, brāhmaṇa). Secondly, he looks like an ascetic (parivräjakarupeṇa, Ram.III.46.4; parivrājakalingena, Rām.III.47.1); that is, he carries the alms-bowl and the water-pot that are the outward signs of the ascetic (cf. Manu VI.52; Baudh.II. 10.17.11; Yajñ.III.58,60). The 'attentions' (satkāraiḥ; cf. satkṛtya, p.184), that Sītā offers him are thus appropriate both to her own forest existence and to the apparent asceticism of the recipient. Manu, for example, rules that forest hermits should live off the produce of the forest (vanyam; Manu VI.12), vegetables, flowers, roots and fruits (śākāni puṣpamūlaphalāni ca; Manu VI.13). Indeed, a brahmin ascetic should ideally receive alms from twice- born householders who also live in the forest (gṛhamedhiṣu canyeṣu dvijeṣu vanavāsiṣu; Manu VI.27). Moreover, the 'cushion' (bṛsi) that Sita offers Ravana is the special bundle of cloth or grass con- sidered appropriate to the ascetic ('Wulst, Bausch von gewundenem Gras u.s.w.', Böhtlingk and Roth). 
The earlier lengthy quotation concerning Draupadi and Jaya- dratha's messenger, Kotikäśya, was taken from Mbh.III.250 (see pp.173-5). In this section, the extract is from the following chapter.

PT prefers the variant reading saumyadarsana for 'darsanam. 
202 
Strīdharmapaddhati 
After receiving Kotikasya's report, Jayadratha decides to pay Draupadi a visit. Draupadi's response is to show him the respect due to the guest. Her formal invitation forms Tryambaka's next quotation. 
'O son of a king, accept this water for washing your feet and this (wooden) seat. Let me give you your morning meal - fifty deer (if you like)! Kunti's son, Yudhisthira, will himself (i.e on his return) present you with black antelopes, spotted deer, nyaňku deer, tawny deer, sarabha deer, sasa deer, nilgai, ruru deer, sambara deer, gayal, and many (other) kinds of deer (mṛga), (as well as) wild boar, wild buffalo and whatever other wild animals (mṛgajātī) there are.'70 
I have taken the term mṛga on its own to denote the various species of deer-at least fifty, according to Draupadi-and mṛgajāti (fem. pl.) to indicate the other kinds of wild animals. For this reason, although sasa can mean either a rabbit or a species of deer (and although van Buitenen prefers the former), I have assumed the latter. For the same reason, and also because bears are not normally considered appropriate food, I have amended the reading in T, (rkṣān) to that in the critical edition of the Maha- bhārata (ṛśyān). The latter term denotes the painted or white-footed antelope, commonly called 'nilgai'. The term gavayān denotes the species of wild cattle called 'gayal' which is traditionally classed as a kind of deer. It is also often confused with the 'cow-deer' (gomrga; translated as 'gayal' by Keith 1914:144; see also Colebrooke 1805), which is included among the sacrificial victims of the aśvamedha (Śat.Br.XIII.2.2.2) and equated elsewhere with cattle (Śat.Br.XIII. 3.4.3). According to Sayana, the gomṛga is a cross between a deer and a bull (Sāy. on Tait.Sam.II.1.10.2). There seems to be good reason, however, to suggest that the nilgai, gayal and gomrga are in fact three quite different animals (see Colebrooke 1805; Eggeling 1978:V,338-9, note 1).

Day 
203 
While Sita's offering of fruit and vegetables is appropriate for the brahmin ascetic, Draupadi's offering of a splendid selection of meat dishes is equally appropriate for a kṣatriya king. (Before their exile, Draupadi supervised the daily feeding of eight thousand brahmins off golden plates; see Sdhp.29v.10–30r.3<Mbh.III.222. 40-3; from section IV, pp.280-1). The other formalities are the same, as is the requirement that the ideal wife obeys the rules of hospitality even when she suspects that her 'guest' is a rogue. In both cases, obedience far outweighs commonsense. 
Tryambaka's final point regarding the role of the wife in offering hospitality concerns her treatment of the Vedic student. 'Because of the smrti statement that it is a sin not to give, women must give alms to Vedic students (brahmacāribhyoh) who come (to the house to beg) for alms.'71 Tryambaka's evidence for this is taken from Apastamba's section on Vedic studentship. The concluding phrase iti hi brāhmaṇam, not given here by Tryambaka, again indicates a quotation from a Brāhmaṇa text (cf. above, pp. 196-7). 
According to Apastamba, ‘if women refuse to give alms to a Vedic student whose mind is concentrated (samähit[ah]), then he will snatch away the (religious merit they have obtained by) srauta sacrifice (vāgair arjitam dharmam; Ujj.), religious donation (dän- enārjitam; Ujj.), oblation (into the domestic fire; darvihomair gārhyair arjitam, Ujj.), (as well as their) offspring, cattle, the glory of sacred learning (brahmavarcasam), and food. That is why the wandering order of Vedic students should never be refused (alms).'72 The last clause, omitted here by Tryambaka, explains that, amongst those students who come to beg at the house, there may well be one who would put that threat into practice (evamvidhi evamvrataḥ). 
Two points may be made here. First, this is the only occasion in Tryambaka's treatment of atithipūjā — apart from the ruling that the wife should act on her husband's behalf when he is away (see notes 66 and 67)—when the injunction is applied specifically to women (strīṇām). Usually, the ruling is either given in the masculine

204 
Stridharmapaddhati 
(e.g. yo mā dadāti; yo datvā; etc.) or applied directly to the male householder (e.g. dvijaḥ, gṛhī, etc.). Despite the fact that the wife's presence is more important than that of her husband, and that she will actually prepare and serve the food, the ruling is invariably aimed at the husband. Moreover, the reward for obedience and the punishment for disobedience are, as we.have seen, both explained in terms of the husband's gain or loss (see pp.188-93, 193–6). The wife's part in all this must be read between the lines. In dharma- śāstra literature in general, however, the rulings relating to giving alms to the Vedic student are consistently couched in the feminine. 
For example, when the student goes on his begging round in the village, he is almost always advised to apply first to one or more women (those who will not refuse, Par.gr.II.5.5-6, Śānkh.gr.II. 6.6; to his mother, Par.gr.II.5.6, Šārikh.gr.II.6.5; or to any female relative who will not refuse, Manu II.50; cf. Aśv.gr.I.22.7). The formula he should use when he begs almost always assumes that he is talking to a woman, the position of the honorific vocative bhavati depending on the varna of the woman addressed (Par.gr.II.5.2-4; Ap.I.1.3.28-30; Manu II.49; see also Wujastyk 1981:34; but cf. Aśv.gr.I.22.8). The distinction between the man's responsibility for the ritual homage of the guest and the woman's responsibility to give alms to the student demonstrates that while the former is a 'great sacrifice' (mahāyajña; see pp.176-8), the latter is not. It seems fitting too that the real Vedic student should beg from the householder's wife, who is traditionally described as a quasi- student in her husband-guru's home (Manu II.67<Sdhp.2r.8-9; see section I, p.35, note 16). 
The second point concerns the things that the student may 'snatch away' from the ungenerous wife. This is not the usual formula of 'reputation, prosperity and long life' but a specific list of religious practices or goals. What is interesting is that Tryambaka himself takes the orthodox line that a woman cannot offer either śrauta or gṛhya sacrifices (section IIB, pp.107-15) or make religi- ous donations in her own right (see section IV, pp.277–80). He does not discuss the question of children, but the orthodox view is that they belong to the husband for he owns both 'seed' and 'field' (e.g. Manu IX.32-3, 35–7; cf. section IV, pp. 300-2). The threat to cattle is to property that Tryambaka maintains is owned by the wife jointly with the rest of the household, although she has no 
 
Day 
right to dispose of it (see section IV, pp.277-80). 
205 
The threat to the wife's 'sacred learning' is the most curious of all. For while the wife may be said to act ‘jointly' with her husband in matters relating to religious rituals, donations, property and children—and thus that the rewards accrue to both of them— this cannot be said of Vedic learning. In the Taittiriyopaniṣad, 'the glory of sacred learning' (brahmavarcasam) — together with off- spring, cattle and fame—is the goal and reward of the enlightened man (Tait.Up.III.6,7,8,9,10). In dharmaśāstra, the same phrase is used specifically in contexts relating to Vedic studentship. Manu II.37, for example, rules that if a brahmin boy desires this goal (brahmavarcasakāmasya), he should be initiated in his fifth year. Kullūka glosses the term as 'the ascetic power made brilliant by such things as knowing how to recite the Veda and knowing what it means' (vedadhyayanatadarthajñānādiprakarṣakrtam tejas). Ac- cording to the orthodox view, this may apply to a woman's husband or to her son, but never to herself. We seem to have three options here. We could assume that the ruling dates from an earlier age when women did have access to Vedic study. Or we could reinterpret the phrase in terms of 'domestic glory' (cf. Sankara's gloss on panditā, discussed in section I, p. 38). Or we could take more literally the maxim that 'husband and wife are one' (yo bharta sa smṛtānganā; Manu IX.45), assume their complete identification in matters of religious achievement and merit (yataś ca dampatyor aikyamataḥ; Kull.), and interpret all the threats accordingly. 
Tryambaka concludes his treatment of atithipüjā by distinguishing between the 'guest' (atithi) proper and other casual visitors. For, as he explains, ‘after the vaiśvadeva ritual, homage should be paid by offering such things as food, as one would to a guest, to other visitors and so on.'73 Any visitor to an Indian home today will find that this is still the case. 
Tryambaka quotes Vyasa. 'At the appropriate time, the wife- that is, the female head of the household (gṛhamukhi)—should always be attentive in (offering) seats, food and gifts, in paying

respect and speaking pleasantly, as is fitting and in accordance with their merits, to (each of the following people): one's elders (or those who are worthy of respect; cf. pp.156-7), the friends of one's son(s), one's relations, the labourers one supports, those one has invited, any male or female slaves (dāsīdāsajanasya), both guests (proper) and (ordinary) visitors, and those religious mendicants who wear a sectarian mark (bhikṣukānām ca linginām).’74 
We may note several things here. First, the ruling is aimed at the 'female head of the household' (grhamukhi), that is, to the senior wife of the male head of the household (whether or not the customs of polygamy and the joint family are in operation). Secondly, the wife's responsibility covers not only the offering of food and so on but also the observation of the correct order of rank or merit (cf. Vas.XI.6). The distinction between ordinary dependent labourers and slaves (or perhaps sudra servants) is interesting. The reference to religious mendicants as a separate category from 'guests' rein- forces my remarks above concerning the Vedic student who comes to beg for alms (pp.203–5). Manu III.94 also distinguishes between the 'guest' (atithi) on the one hand and the ascetic (bhikṣave; parivrāje, Kull.) and the student (brahmacārine; prathamāśramiṇe, Kull.) on the other. Both the ascetic and the student are entitled to receive food and so on, but neither should be termed 'guests'. 
This is not for lack of respect. The renouncer in particular is accorded enormous respect by householders. For example, Hara- datta on Āp.II.2.4.10, indicates that some food should be set aside as alms before one even attends to one's guests. According to Par. Sm.I.51, one must perform the candrayana penance if one fails to give alms to the student and the ascetic before one eats oneself. Even in the twentieth century, a pious woman on a student's regular begging round will not eat until the student has come for his share (Wujastyk 1981:34). But it is customary for a genuine religious mendicant to disturb a household as little as possible; to come when the cooking is done, when the meal is finished, and even the remains have been cleared away (Manu VI.56; Vas.X.8); certainly never to

sit down to a formal meal (cf. Olivelle 1977:47-8). Food is no longer of great importance to him. Nonetheless, as Tryambaka explains in his section on general behaviour, the ideal wife never eats before she has distributed food to gods, ancestors, guests, servants, cows and the company of religious mendicants (bhikṣukuleṣu, Sdhp. 23r.10-23v.1; from section IV, pp.273-4). The reference to a sec- tarian mark (cf. section IIA, pp.99-100), deliberately excludes mendicants belonging to non-Hindu sects. Buddhist and Jain monks, for example, and others like them, should not be fed at all by the orthodox Hindu. 
Surprisingly, Tryambaka does not in fact define the term 'guest' (atithi). The definitions in other texts are various. According to the Aitareyaranyaka, for example, if one attains excellence' (śrestatām aśnute) one is a guest; if not, then one is not worthy of hospitality (Ait. Ār.I.1.1). The Rāmāyana episode regarding Sītā and Rāvana assumes a definition that does not exclude the religious mendicant. In the Kathopanisad, the term seems to cover any brahmin who has arrived unexpectedly. Later authorities rule that a brahmin should not treat a man of lower caste as a 'guest' (Gaut.I. 1.39; Manu III.110–12; Āp.II.2.4.18-20). According to Parāśara, the term denotes someone, not from one's own village, who does not stay long (anityam āgataḥ, Par.Sm.1.42; cf. Gaut.I.5.36). Mādhava comments that all those who move on before the day is over (tithipurvotsavāḥ sarve) may be called 'guests'; the rest are merely 'visitors' (seṣān abhyāgatān; Par.M.I.i.p.p.398, Yama). As noted above, Manu excludes anyone who is from the same village or on a social or business call (Manu III.103; Par.M.I.i.p.398-9). The previous verse defines the guest as a brahmin who stays for only one night, and derives the term accordingly (anityam hi sthito yasmāt tasmăd atithir ucyate; Manu III.102). In the Visnupurana, the term denotes one whose family is not known (ajñātakulanāmānam), who is destitute (akiñcanam), unrelated to oneself (asambandham), or from another country (anyadesāt samāgatam; Vis.P.III.11. 59-60; cf. Par.M.I.p.398). The Märkandeyapurāna excludes friends (mitram; cf. Manu III.110,113), defining the guest as a brahmin who arrives hungry (bubhukṣum), tired (śrāntam) or begging (vācamānam; Märk.P.29.26-8; Par.M.I.i.p.399). The last of these conflicts with the rulings given earlier classing mendicants and Vedic students as 'non-guests', but agrees with the Rāmāyaṇa episode.

Tryambaka next considers the order in which 'guests' and 'visitors' should be made welcome. According to Apastamba, 'the feeding of guests comes first."75 The quotation runs as follows. ‘One should feed guests first of all; then children, the old, the sick and any pregnant woman ([a]ntarvatniḥ; but see Ujj. below). The two owners (of the house) should not refuse anyone who asks for food at the (appropriate) time.'76 The last sutra is also quoted at the beginning of this section on atithipüjā (see above, note 43). 
To explain these rulings further, Tryambaka quotes at length from the Ujjvală, Haradatta's commentary on the Apastambadharma- sūtra. "The term "guests" he (Apastamba) will explain (later). One should feed them first of all. One should not eat either with them or before them. And those children who are living in one's house one should also feed first (i.e. before oneself). Since the term antarvatnī ("pregnant woman") is complete in itself (siddha), the word strī (“woman”) is meant to indicate sisters and so on as well. The use of the term antarvatni means that she (the pregnant woman) should always be honoured (in this way). "At the (appropriate) time” means at the time of the vaiśvadeva ritual; that is, at the end of it. The two owners (svāminau), that is, the master and mistress of the house (gṛhapatī), should not refuse anyone who has come there hoping for food. Something should definitely be given to him.'77 
Tryambaka concludes the commentary himself. ‘(This is so) because it says in the Mahābhārata, “she who gives food at the (appropriate) time". "Children, the old and the sick" means

"everyone". Therefore what is needed (food, etc.) should be given to whoever (comes) at whatever time (he comes).'78 
Several points are worth noting here. First, it is interesting that not only important guests and casual visitors but also dependants such as children, the old and the sick should be fed before the master of the house. Even more remarkable is Haradatta's suggestion that women such as 'sisters and so on' should be fed before him. How- ever, if we compare similar rulings in Manu III.114, Vas.XI.7 and Baudh.II.7.13.5, we find some agreement with Haradatta's inter- pretation. Manu, for example, suggests that, even before one's guests, one should feed suvasinih, as well as children, the sick, and pregnant women (garbhinih). In this context, the term suvāsinī means 'a woman who lives in a good or comfortable house', and usually denotes the daughter, whether married or not, who lives in her father's house (cf. Medh. on Manu III.114). Both Sarva- jñanārāyaṇa and Nandana read svavasiniḥ and take it to mean 'sisters'. Vas.XI.7 rules that, after feeding one's guests, one should feed the following members of one's own family (svagṛhyāṇām): the unmarried girls (kumāri), the children (bāla), the old, the adolescent boys (taruna') and the pradātāḥ. Unable to translate the last term, Bühler retains it while suggesting that it denotes ‘a class of female relatives'. The Calcutta edition amends it to pra- bhṛtin ('dependants'), while Führer's edition reads prajātāḥ ('women who have given birth'; Bühler 1965:50, note 7). Baudhāyana's ruling simply lists 'guests, pregnant women, children, the old, the wretched and the sick', and makes no mention of other women at all. 
Certainly, the custom in the more traditional homes today is for the women to eat only after their menfolk, guests and children have been served. However, it is also a widespread custom for the pregnant woman to return to her parents' home to deliver her child. In this case, the pregnant woman would also be the daughter or sister of the household. Haradatta's 'sisters and so on' would therefore include the unmarried and therefore very young girls, the married daughters on a visit home, pregnant women and those who have recently delivered a child. It would not include the wives of the

male members of the household. In view of the importance of children and other rulings on pregnancy, the special treatment of the pregnant woman is not surprising (cf. section IV, pp.289-90). Finally, Tryambaka's last rather sweeping comment seems to render unnecessary most of the careful rulings he has made so far. 
The final (unattributed) quotation in this section is attributed to the Anusāsanaparvan of the Mahabharata in section IV. 'The woman who provides food for weak, helpless, wretched, blind and poverty-stricken brahmins is (rightly called) "one who participates in the religious observances of her husband (pativratabhāginī).”78 
This quotation reinforces two major points concerning atithi- püjä. First, it emphasizes the importance of the brahmin recipient of food and homage. As we have seen, the brahmin is the ideal guest for kṣatriya households (such as those in court circles) and, ac- cording to some, the only guest acceptable to the brahmin host. Secondly, the wife's tasks of preparing food, welcoming the guest, speaking pleasantly and serving him are all seen as her duty towards her husband's religious commitments rather than her own. In her role of ritual assistant, the wife's religious duty is to assist her husband in his (pativratabhāginī; cf. pp.50, 107–15, 281–2). 
At meals (bhojanam; Sdhp.16v.8-19r.9) 
Tryambaka next describes the duties of the wife that relate to eating (plates 6-9). This is an important topic in dharmasastra for, ac- cording to Manu V.4, mistakes in this sphere (annadoṣāt) are among the four main causes of death to brahmins. (The others are lack of Vedic study, failure to perform the appropriate actions, and lazi- ness.) In fact, Tryambaka's presentation is by no means as elaborate as one might expect. His rulings may be divided into six categories: the wife's duty to serve at meals; the requirement that she should not be present when her husband eats; how she should serve the food; her own meal; her offering to the goddess Jyesthā; and, lastly, her post-prandial obligations such as clearing up and offering betel. 
Tryambaka begins with the statement that the religious duty of

women also includes serving at meals (pariveṣaṇam).80 Four quotations follow: the first indicates the duty of the wife to serve food to brahmins; the remaining three describe her duty to serve at her husband's meal (see plate 7). 
The story of Uttańka,81 from the Adiparvan of the Mahābhārata, is a curious one and Tryambaka quotes only what he needs. Uttaňka is a student living in the house of his brahmin teacher, Veda. When Veda has to go away for a time, he asks his pupil to take his place (yat kimcid asmadgṛhe parihiyate tad icchamy aham aparihiņam bhavatā kriyamānam iti; Mbh.I.3.86). During Veda's absence, however, his senior wife (upadhyāyini; see below) comes into her 'season' (ṛtumatī; that is, she enters the period after menstruation when husband and wife should make love). The other women (strībhih) instruct Uttańka to substitute for Veda in this matter also (Mbh.I.3.89). Uttańka refuses on the grounds that intercourse with one's teacher's wife is forbidden (akāryam); and Veda's orders do not include wrong-doing (Mbh.1.3.90). When Veda returns, he rewards Uttanka by granting him leave to go (i.e. his period of studentship is deemed to have been successfully completed). But when Uttanka asks to give the traditional thanks-offering (gurv- artham; Mbh.I.3.95), Veda cannot decide what he wants. He sends Uttanka to his wife instead; and his pupil repeats the question to her (Mbh.I.3.98-9). Tryambaka's quotation contains her response. 
'Addressed in this way, the teacher's wife answered Uttanka. "Go to Pausya. Beg from him the earrings worn by his kṣatriyā wife, and bring them (to me). In four days, there will be a religious ceremony, and I wish to serve food to the brahmins wearing those earrings. On that day, I shall make myself beautiful with those earrings. May good fortune be yours-(go and) beg!"'82 
80. pariveṣaṇam api strīdharmaḥ // Sdhp.16v.8. 
81. Regarding the spelling of the name, the critical edition reads Uttanka'. Despite Sukthankar's second thoughts (addenda to Mbh.I.3.86) and van Buitenen's preference for Utanka', I have retained Tryambaka's spelling. According to Sukthankar, this is the spelling of the Bengali MSS, 'Udanka' being preferred by the southern recension.

Strīdharmapaddhati 
Tryambaka's point is that if brahmins are to be fed, then the host's chief wife should serve them. We may note two further points. First, the story is an interesting demonstration of a conflict of duties: the student's duty to obey his teacher to the letter; the prohibition on intercourse with one's teacher's wife (one of the five mahāpātakas or 'great sins'; cf. pp.219-20); and the duty not to let a woman's 'season' (rtu) pass neglected (ṛtukāladharmaḥ; section IV, pp.287-8). Uttanka solves his problem by weighing the opinions of the women (strīṇām vacanam) against the unspoken intentions of his teacher; not surprisingly, the latter prevails. In the final section of his treatise, Tryambaka discusses the question of women caught in similar conflicts. His advice is predictable: the wife's first duty is to obey her husband even when this conflicts with other duties (itaradharmopamardenāpi; see section V, pp.308-9), even when it involves uoing something that is normally considered wrong (akaryakarane 'pi; section V, pp.309-12). In Tryambaka's view, therefore, Veda's wife is in the wrong: her duty to obey her hus- band's wishes should outweigh the urgency of the ṛtu. All the more surprising perhaps that Tryambaka refers to the episode at all. 
Secondly, the terms kṣatriya and upādhyāyinī (or, more common- ly, upadhyāyānī; see Mbh.1.3.100, variant reading) are of more than grammatical interest. Pāṇ.IV.1.4 (ajādy ataṣ tāp) rules that nominal stems in a form feminines in -a. Thus sudra ('a sudra man') be- comes sūdrā ('a sudra woman'; Kāś.); kṣatriya ('a kṣatriya man') becomes kṣatriyā (a kṣatriya woman'); upādhyāya (‘a male teacher') becomes upadhyāyā ('a female teacher'; Katy. on Pan.III.3.21); ācārya (‘a male teacher') becomes ācāryā ('a female teacher'). Pāṇ.IV.1.48 (pumyogad akhyāyām) rules that the suffix -7 indicates the wife in relation to her husband. Thus sūdra (a śūdra man') becomes sūdrī ('the wife of a sūdra man'; Kāś. on Pān.IV.1.4). Similarly, gaṇaka (‘a male astrologer') becomes either gaṇakā (‘a female astrologer') or gaṇaki ('an astrologer's wife'; ganakasya strī gaṇakī, Kāś. on Pan.IV.1.48), depending on who has the knowledge of astrology. Other examples cited by the Käsikā include mahā- mātrī ('the wife of a chief minister') and praṣthī ('the wife of a chief”).

N.B. variant readings give both upādhyāyānī and upādhyāyi.. 
 
Day

Such words apply to the woman because of her relationship with her husband (pumyogād ete sabdaḥ striyām vartante), and not because she possesses that same quality herself (na tu pumāmsamācakṣate; Kāś. on Pāṇ.IV.1.48). Pāṇ.IV.1.49 (°ācāryāṇam ānuk) rules that certain words such as ācārya add the augment an before the suffix -ī to indicate this relationship of wife to husband. Thus Indra be- comes Indrāni ('Indra's wife'); Varuna becomes Varuṇānī ('Varuna's wife'); and ācārya ('male teacher') becomes ācāryāṇī (‘a teacher's wife'). According to the Käsikā, several words take this augument optionally. Thus upādhyāya ('male teacher') becomes either upă- dhyādhyānī or upādhyāyī (both denoting 'the wife of the teacher'; see Mbh.I.3.100, variant readings; cf. Katy. on Pan.III.3.21); kṣatriya becomes kṣatriyāṇī or kṣatriyā (both denoting the wife of a kṣatriya). It is not clear, therefore, whether the use of the term ksatriyā in the Mahābhārata quotation is meant to indicate a kṣatriya woman or the wife of a kṣatriya man; in fact epic Sanskrit is often not precise. The use of the term upādhyāyiṇī (and variant readings upādhyāyānī and upādhāyī) is clear: the knowledge belongs to the husband not the wife. It should be understood, however, that the distinction between women teachers and the wives of teachers admits of the possibility—in Panini's time if not in Tryambaka's-of women of both categories. 
Tryambaka's next three quotations demonstrate that the wife should serve her husband at meals. In the Vanaparvan of the Mahā- bhārata, we are told that 'the glorious Draupadi, like a mother, first gave food to all her (five) husbands and to the brahmins and (only) then took what was left (sistam; i.e. for herself).'83 According to the Agnipurāṇa, the wife 'should provide for her husband what- ever he likes in a meal, and bring it to him herself. '84 According to Vyāsa, 'one should always eat food that is mixed with ghee, is hot, beneficial, wholesome and of a moderate amount; and which is given (served) by one's wife after she has herself washed the dishes. '85 These quotations all stress the attentive service required of the

wife. The reference to Draupadi feeding her husbands ‘like a mother' (māteva) recalls the popular subhāṣita that describes the ideal wife as one who is like a slave in her work (kārye dāsī), like a courtesan in bed (ratau veśyā), a mother with regard to food (bhojane jananī- samā), and a counsellor in adversity (vipatsu māntriṇī, vipattau buddhidātrī; Pad.P. srstikhanda 47.56; Subh.p.366, satīvarṇanam 9, 27). The Buddhist equivalent, the patibbatā, is similarly defined as a woman who cares for her husband as devotedly as a mother does for her child (Vim.I.11). Even the Buddha, lecturing the unruly Sujātā on strīdharma, lists the motherly type (mātā) among the four desirable kinds of wife; the others are the sisterly type (bhagini), the companion (sakhi) and the slave (dāsī; Ang. Nik.IV.p.91-4). Unlike Draupadi, however, Sujātā opts to be her husband's slave. Tryambaka alludes to these types himself in his section on women's property: Kausalya's virtue is demonstrated by the fact that she relates to her husband as slave (dāsīvat), friend (sakhīvat), wife (bhāryāvat), sister (bhaginīvat) and mother (mātṛvat), even when her husband ill-treats her (Sdhp.26[2]r.6-26[2]v.2; from section IV, pp.277-80). 
The reference to a 'measured' (mitam) amount of food indicates that the good wife should not overfeed her husband. For excessive eating (atibhojanam) does one harm both in this world (anarogyam anāyuṣyam) and in the next (asvargyam; Manu II.57). 
Tryambaka's second major point is that 'the wife should not be in the presence of her husband when he is eating. '86 The ruling for this is taken from Yājñavalkya. 'One should not eat in the sight of one's wife (bhāryādarśane); nor when wearing (only) one (the lower) garment; nor when standing up.'87 Vijñāneśvara glosses bhārya- darśane as 'in front of her when she is nearby' (tasyām purato 'vasthitāyām; Mit. on Yajñ.I.131). Apararka understands both 'while he is looking at her' (bhāryām paśyams) and 'while she is looking at him' (taya ca drṣyamānas tathā; Apar.p.173). To explain 'the sin (involved) in the presence of the wife' (patnyaḥ sanni- dhāne doṣam (i.e. when her husband is eating), both Tryambaka and Vijñānesvara quote the same śruti statement. 'A man should not

eat in the vicinity of his wife or his offspring will be without strength. '88 
This idea is evidently one of long standing. For the dizzying array of mystical correspondences set out in the Satapathabrāhmaṇa includes that between the sun, the altar and the eye and, further, that between 'the man in the sun' (mandale puruṣaḥ), 'the gold man' (hiranmayaḥ puruṣaḥ) in the altar, and 'the man in the right eye' (daksine 'ksan purusaḥ; Sat.Br.X.5.2.6-7). The last of these images is expanded in the verses that follow. Since a man is not complete without his mate, his other half, there is a second 'person' in the left eye (savye 'kşan purusah), thus making a pair or couple (mithu nam; Śat.Br.X.5.2.8). The 'person' in the right eye is Indra; that in the left is Indrānī and the god created the nose to keep them apart (vidhṛtim akurvan nāsikām; cf. section IIA, p.78). For this reason the husband should not eat food in the presence of his wife; and if they eat apart, a strong son (viryavan) will be born (Sat.Br.X.5.2.9). Since among men, kings keep apart the most, they are the ones who have strong sons (Śat.Br.X.5.2.10). The last remark presumably refers to the predominantly kṣatriya customs of polygamy and separate women's quarters. 
The significance of Tryambaka's prohibition, however, is by no means obvious. In the Smṛticandrika's treatment of the subject, for example, the emphasis is on privacy in general. A man should eat in private (etac ca bhojanam rahasi kāryam; Sm.C.II.p.599). For if he eats in private (guptaḥ), he becomes rich; if he eats in public (pra- kāśe), his wealth is lost (Sm.C.II.p.599, Devala). According to some, one should eat entirely alone, that is, even apart from one's own relatives and other brahmins. For if several people sit down to eat in the same row, then each is liable to take on the effects of the others' sins (Sm.C.II.p.619, Brhaspati; cf. ekapankti, below, p.221; and one never knows the secret sins of another man (Sm. C.II.p.618, Ād.P.). This idea explains why even today an orthodox brahmin would not dream of eating in a public restaurant. Else- where, the question of being looked at by someone who is not eating arises. According to Uśanas, for example, a man should not eat when many people who are not eating are watching (bahūnām 
88. patnyaḥ sannidhāne doṣam āha śrutih // jāyāyā ante näśniyad aviryavad apatyam bhavati // iti // Sdhp.17r.6-7 (śruti) < Mit. on Yajñ.I.131. Cf. Sat. Br.X.5.2.9; Vas.XII.31; Vis.Sm.68.46.

Strīdharmapaddhati 
ca paśyatām); nor should many eat when one such person is watch- ing (ekasya pasyataḥ; Sm.C.II.p.615). However, Vis.Sm.68.46 differentiates between this ruling (bahūnām prekṣamāṇānām nai- kasmin bahavas tatha) and the requirement not to eat 'together with' one's wife (nāśnīyād bhāryayā sārdham), thus implying that the reasons behind them are different. 
In fact, this very common ruling not to eat 'with' one's wife is usually interpreted to mean not simply that he should eat apart from her but that he should not eat from the same dish. For example, Gautama's prohibition on ‘eating with one's wife' (bhāryayā saha bhojana) is glossed by Haradatta as ‘eating from one dish together with one's wife' (bhāryayā sahaikasmin bhäjane bhojanam; Har. on Gaut.1.9.32). Kullūka interprets a similar ruling in Manu IV.43 (nāśniyād bhāryayā sārdham) in much the same way (bharyayā sahaikapātre näśnīyāt, Kull.; särdham ekapātre, Sarv.). For Medhātithi, the prohibition also applies to eating at the same time and place as one's wife (ekādhikaranam ekakāladeśam). 
It is clear, however, that such views were not universally accepted. Nandapandita, for example, applies the prohibition only to the lower-caste wife (bhāryā asavarnā; Nand. on Vis.Sm.68.46, Adyar edn.). Several commentators and digest writers allow a brahmin to eat with his brahmin wife (e.g. Sm.C.II.p.617; Mit. on Yājñ.III.200; Par.M.I.i.p.425). According to the Smṛtyarthasara, a man may only eat from the same dish as his wife at the time of their marriage (na bhāryaya sahāsnīyād vivāhavarjyam; Sm.A.p.69). In Baudh.I.1.2.3, however, there is an interesting distinction between the customs of north and south, one that often proves useful to commentators faced with conflicting rules (e.g. Ujj. on Āp.II.4.9.7). Eating with an uninitiated person (anupetena saha bhojanam) and eating with one's wife (striya saha bhojanam) are listed among the five practices peculiar to the south. (The other three are eating stale food and marrying the daughter of either one's maternal uncle or one's paternal aunt.) According to some authorities, the customs of a particular region do not incur sin when practised in that region (Baudh.I.1.2.6); according to others, the traditions of the learned and the conduct of those who live in Aryavarta are always authori- tative (Baudh.I.1.2.7-9; Gaut.XI.20). The north-south boundary is the river Narmada, running north of Maharashtra. Tryambaka seems to side with the latter view. Thus, although it may be the 
Day 
217 
custom for southerners to eat with their wives, in his opinion this is 
wrong. 
There follows a discussion of how the wife should serve the meal. Tryambaka's first point is that 'when she is serving, she should not serve the food and so on by hand.'89 He quotes two ślokas attributed to Śātātapa. '(Eating) dishes which are served by hand, and salt served separately (as opposed to salt used in the cooking), is held to be like eating earth or the consumption of cow's meat.'90 'One should not eat salt, condiments, ghee, oil, or any of the variety of foods that are licked (from the tips of one's fingers, e.g. pickles) or drunk (e.g. soups, sauces, buttermilk, etc.) if they are served by hand.'91 Two further slokas attributed to Yama follow. 'When alms- food, salt and condiments are served by hand, whoever eats them becomes impure and whoever serves them will not go to heaven.'92 'When served by hand, delicacies (snehā[h]), salt and condiments do the giver no good, while whoever eats them eats sin.'93 For, ac- cording to Atri, 'when ghee or oil falls from the nails of a brahmin woman (when she is serving food by hand), that (food) is deemed inedible; whoever eats it must perform the candrayana fast.'94 According to Apastamba, ‘if ghee, oil, salt, liquids, anything made with milk (e.g. rice cooked in milk and sugar), or alms-food is 89. pariveṣaṇasamaye annādikam hastena na pariveṣaṇīyam // Sdhp.17r.7. 90. tatha ca śātātapaḥ // hastadattāni cănnāni pratyakṣalavanam taṭhā / mṛttikābhakṣaṇam caiva gomāmsābhyasanam smṛtam // Sdhp.17r.7-8 (Sat.)< Sm.M.II.p.430 (gaumāmsabhyasanam for go; Sat.); Par.M.I.i.p.428 (go- māmsāśanavat for gomāmsābhyasanam; Sat.); Sm.C.II.p.604 (as Par.M.).

served by hand, it is not to be accepted anywhere; and therefore one should serve (such) food (only if it is) contained in a leaf or grass (bowl or cup) and not by hand. '95 
Bowls, plates or cups are still woven from certain large leaves (e.g. drona, Marathi; katori, Hindi) and broad-leaved grasses (topli, Marathi) for the use of traditional families, even educated urbanites, especially at times of large gatherings such as weddings and festivals. The Smrticandrikā quotes Paithīnasi's rulings con- cerning the types of leaves that may be used in this way (Sm.C.II. p.602). The custom is even more prevalent in southern India where banana leaves are much in evidence as plates not only in rural homes but also in some city restaurants. 
More important, all these rulings, like the previous ones pro- hibiting a man from sharing a dish with his wife, relate to the prohibitions on eating the so-called 'left-overs' (ucchistam). If the person serving touches the food, then it is classed with the 'left- overs' of that person's meal, and as such impure and (therefore) prohibited to anyone else (see pp.221-7). 
Tryambaka continues. "This is why food should be served with a ladle or something similar (darvyādinā).'% In order to make sense of the collection of rulings that follow, several emendations to the text have been necessary. These rest upon the assumption that the items that should not be served by hand (i.e. food in general, condiments, salt, alms-food, ghee, oil, anything cooked in milk, all liquids and 'lickable' substances, etc.; see above) are precisely those that should be served with some instrument such as a ladle (i.e. cooked food or food cooked in milk or ghee, condiments, water, food cooked in oil, and even uncooked food; see below). As we shall see, neither Kane's distinction between cooked and uncooked foods (PVK II.ii.p.762) nor Vidyarṇava's distinction between 'liquid and semi-liquid articles' and non-liquid ones (1979:165) is borne out by these rulings. 
The first quotation is attributed to Āpastamba, 'Cooked food (kṛtānnam; alternatively, 'food cooked in milk', śṛtānnam; or 'food cooked in ghee', ghṛtānnam; see note 97) and all condiments

should be served with a ladle.'97 Āpastamba is also credited with the pronouncement regarding 'the sin (involved) in serving water and so on without a ladle ([ā]darvyā; i.e. by hand).'98 'Whoever wishes to serve water or cooked food without a ladle ([']darvyā) is (on the same level as) a brahmin-killer (bhrūnahā), a drinker of alcohol, a thief and one who sleeps with his teacher's wife. Neither food cooked with oil nor uncooked food should ever be (served) without a ladle (t[va]darvyā).'99 
We may note first that here, as so often before, Tryambaka depends heavily on the Smṛtimuktāphala. The similarity of both quotations and attributions suggest that they have been drawn directly from it. Secondly, the term bhrūna in bhrūṇahā may mean either 'brahmin' (e.g. Gaut.II.8.11, Har.; Vas.II.42, XX.23) or 'foetus' (e.g. Gaut.III.3.9, Har.; Vas.XX.23; cf. bhrūṇaghnim, Sdhp.38r.4-5, section IV, p.288). Since the purpose of this ruling is to convey absolute condemnation, I have preferred the former interpretation. For brahmin-murder is held to be the greatest crime of all (Manu VIII.381). It is invariably classed as one of the five 'great sins' for which no expiation is possible (mahāpātaka; the fifth, not mentioned here, is consorting with the perpetrators of the other four; cf. Manu XI.54, Yājñ.III.227, Vas.I.20). The classifi- cation of apparently mundane wrong actions (such as serving water without a ladle) as on a par with brahmin-murder is a standard — if extravagant-means of outright condemnation in dharma- śāstra. Tryambaka quotes a similar parallel in relation to the

bad practice of serving unequal portions to diners sitting in the same row (see below). 
Tryambaka turns to Parāśara for 'the sin (involved in) serving food in a vessel made of iron' (āyasa; 'le fer', Finot 1896:34), 100 'If food is brought in an iron vessel, he (i.e. whoever eats it) eats the left-overs (ucchiṣṭa) of a dog, and whoever gives it goes to hell. Whether one is bathing, sipping or doing anything else, an iron vessel is inappropriate. '101 
In view of the variety of rulings available, Tryambaka's insis- tence on this point alone is curious. Certainly, Hārīta prohibits iron and earthenware vessels (Sm.C.II.p.602). But Ap.I.5.17.9-12 declares that one may eat out of an earthenware vessel that has either not been used (anāprīte mrnmaye bhoktavyam) or, if used, has been baked in fire (aprītam ced abhidagdhe); out of a metal one (lohāni; ‘métaux', Finot 1896:12,90) that has been well scoured (parimṛstam lauham prayatam; bhasmabhiḥ parimṛṣṭam; Ujj.); or out of a wooden one that has been well scraped (nirlikhitam dāruma- yam). Moreover, Manu's rules of purification give precise details on how to clean vessels of gold, stone, silver, copper, iron, brass and so on (Manu V.111ff.). Certain materials are prohibited to certain individuals. An ascetic for example, is not to use a metal vessel (ataijasāni pātrāṇi, Manu VI.53; glossed by Kull. as 'gold, copper, brass or iron'; cf. Mit. on Yājñ.III.60; Yatidh.57.79-92; Olivelle 1977:37,168). Similarly, bronze vessels (kāmsyapātra) are prohi- bited to ascetics, Vedic students and widows (Sdhp.46v.1-2, Samvarta, Sm.C.II.p.602, Pracetas; see section IV, p.299). While Manu IV.65 prohibits the use of broken vessels, the Smrti- candrika allows broken ones made of copper, silver, gold, conch or stone (Sm.C.II.p.601, Paithīnasi). The menstruating woman, how- ever, should ideally use only her own cupped hands (section IV, pp.284-5). The number of different and often conflicting rulings on this subject makes Tryambaka's single prescription all the more surprising. 
Still on the subject of how the wife should serve the food, Tryam- baka rules that she should show no favouritism. 'When she is

serving, she should not, on account of (her feelings of) affection and so forth, give unequal servings to those seated in the same row (ekapanktyupaviṣṭānām).'102 His evidence for this is attributed to Vasistha. 'When one gives (food) unequally to a row of diners (eka- panktau)—whether out of love or fear or the desire for gain-this action, seen in the Vedas and described in verse by the sages, the seers call "brahmin-murder" (brahmahatyām; cf. above).'103 
A 'row of diners' (ekapankti) is a continuous line not broken by such formal barriers as a pillar, a door, a passage, changes of ground level, or even by lines drawn on the ground with powder or ashes (as is the custom even today in large gatherings such as weddings). Those sitting together in this continuous row must be of the same caste and social rank. Āp.I.5.17.2, for example, rules that one should not sit in the same row with unworthy people (anarhadbhir vā samānapanktau); glossed by Haradatta as those who lack good family, learning and moral conduct (abhijanavidyāvṛttarahitä; Ujj. on Āp.I.5.17.2). For, as I have already remarked, those who sit together in this way partake of each other's sins (see above, p.215). It follows, therefore, that those who sit in the same row are neces- sarily of the same rank, and so they should be treated equally. 
Tryambaka's next subsection concerns the wife's own meal. His first point is that 'she should pay homage to her husband's feet (bhartuḥ pädavandanam) before she eats.'104 His evidence is attri- buted to 'Skanda.' 'One supreme rule is pronounced for women: she should (first) pay homage to her husband's feet and then eat; this is the firm opinion (of the authorities). '105 
Unlike the custom of paying homage to the feet of one's parents- in-law (see pp.161-2), that of touching the husband's feet is no

longer in evidence in Maharashtra today, nor was it even eighty years ago except perhaps as a preliminary to the wedding night (LSJ). Nonetheless, this gesture-reflecting as it does the many smrti statements to the effect that the husband is the 'god and master' of the wife (e.g. Manu V.154; Răm.II.24.21; Mbh.XIII. 134.51)—clearly was practised in orthodox households at least until the middle of the eighteenth century. Indeed, as already noted above (p.138), the high-caste village women of Nepal still 'pay homage' to their husbands' feet before every rice meal by drinking their 'foot water' (Bennett 1983: 174–5). Another possible inter- pretation of the ruling is that the wife should massage her husband's feet to relax him after the meal (see plate 8). 
Tryambaka's second point is that 'the wife (patnī) should eat what is left (ucchistam) after her husband has eaten (plate 9).106 This ruling is supported by three quotations. The first is attributed to Manu. 'After drinking the apośanam, a man should eat what has been given (to him) on his plate if there is nothing wrong with it and then he should leave some remainder (ucchistam) for his wife, his servants and his slaves.'107 According to Vyasa, 'she (i.e. the good wife) desires what is given by her husband: she should eat what is left of her husband's food, water, fruit and so on, saying "This is a great prasada!"'108 Tryambaka's statement that 'the wife should eat only after her husband has eaten' is also supported with a quotation attributed to Vyasa. 'If she (first) serves the gods, guests and servants, and her husband too, and then-according to the rules (of tradition) and the (Vedic) injunction-eats the food that is left over (seṣān- nam), her household will always be well fed and contented, and she will be firmly grounded in her religious duty.'109

Apośana is the technical term for the water sipped from the cupped hand (from the brahmatīrtha; see acamana, section IIA, pp.75-7), in the ritual performed before eating (bhojanavidhí). After the vaisvadeva ritual, when the food is served, the man about to eat sprinkles water around the plate (paryușitam), announcing to the god of food: 'You are truth and I sprinkle you with truth' (satyam tva rtena pariṣiñcāmi, in the evening; ṛtam tvā satyena parişincămi, at midday; Sm.A.69-70). Next, he makes offerings of rice on the ground beside his plate (baliharanam) to the lord of the earth (bhupataye svāhā/bhuvanapataye svāhā/bhūtānām pataye svähā//). Then he sips a little water (apośanam; cf. Yājñ.I.106) from the base of his thumb, while announcing that it is nectar and will act as a 'cushion' for the god of food (amṛtopastaranam asi). Then he makes five offerings of rice to the five 'breaths' (prānāya svāhā| apānāya svāhā| udānāya svāhā| vyānāya svāhā| sāmānāya svähä //). After these five präṇāhutis, the late digests (and modern practice) add a sixth offering to Brahman: he touches water, then his eyelids and forehead (saying, brahmane namah), and only then begins to eat (LSJ;PVK II.i.p.764). At the end of the meal, he again sips a little water, announcing this time that it will act as the 'cover' for the god of food (amṛtāpidhānam asi). This ritual of bhojanavidhi is performed only by men. With some variations, it is still practised in the more orthodox households today (cf. Vidyārṇava 1979:163– 5). 
Ucchista is what is left on a person's plate after he has eaten, with some exceptions (ucchistaseṣaṇam tu ghṛtādivyatiriktaviṣayam; Par.M.I.i.p.422). In fact, it was important not to eat everything on one's plate. As both the Parāśaramādhavīya and the Smṛtimuktā- phala explain, a man should always leave some food on his plate after a meal, except for certain specific substances (e.g. curd, honey, ghee, milk; Par.M.I.i.p.422; Sm.M.II.p.431). These 'permitted left- overs' are to be given to his dependants: to his wife, servants or slaves, as Tryambaka's quotation explains. No one else should eat them. Even a sudra may not do so unless he is a dependant (Manu IV.80; but cf. Vas.XI.10). A similar prohibition from Apastamba adds that if one does give these remnants to a non-brahmin, one should clean one's teeth and put the food particles thus acquired back on the plate before offering it (dantän skuptvä vilikhya tan- malam tasminn ucchisteva dhāya dadyāt; Ujj. on Ap.I.11.31.22), thus making its impurity graphically clear. The ruling that one 
 
224 
Strīdharmapaddhati 
should not eat the remains of anyone else's meal is relaxed only for the child (who may eat his parents' left-overs; cf. Sm.M.II.p.431); for the student (who should eat those of his teacher, at least in a formal sense; cf. Mit. on Yājñ.1.33; Baudh.1.2.3.35,etc.); for ser- vants (who should eat those of their master); and, in particular, for the wife (who should eat those of her husband, from his plate). Thus when Draupadi, disguised as a servant, agrees to work for Virāta's queen Sudeṣṇā, she insists that she will only work for one who does not give her 'left-overs' to eat or make her wash his feet (yo me na dadyād ucchiṣṭam na ca pādau pradhāvayet; Mbh.IV.8.29). The agreement between the two women that such things will not be required of her amounts to a promise that Virāta will make no sexual demands of Draupadi; that is, he will not treat her like a wife. Hence too the ruling that the menstruating woman should not eat from her husband's plate until she has been purified on the fourth day: marital intimacy is excluded at this time (see p.285). 
It must be remembered, however, that for food to be acceptable in the first place, it must already be the sanctified 'left-overs' of the gods, ancestors, guests and anyone else on the list of priority given above. As Manu explains in several slokas, the householder should eat what remains (sesa) after he has offered food to the gods, sages, guests, ancestors and household deities (Manu III.117); he and his wife should eat what is left (avasistam) after the brahmins, relatives and servants have eaten (Manu III.116). A man who eats without first providing for guests and dependants is doomed (Manu III.115, 118); whereas the food that is left after the performance of a sacrifice (vajñaśista) is the food of virtuous men (Manu III.118). Thus, just as a man looks forward to eating the prasāda of a sacrifice or pūjā, believing it to be blessed by the ritual offering (cf. Gonda 1980: 187ff.; Vidyārṇava 1979:163; Morinis 1984:73), so the wife should look forward to eating the prasada left on her husband's plate after the ritual of eating, believing it to be doubly blessed. In this context, Tryambaka's use of the term patni seems apt: we may conclude both that the practice is a religious duty rather than merely a domestic matter, and that it is the privilege of the chief wife. The explicit reference to the husband's 'left-overs' as prasāda is a further reflection of the traditional belief that a woman's husband is her primary god. In more general terms, as Parry explains, what pollutes the pure purifies the impure (1979: 97-100). Thus the 'left- overs' of the higher castes purify the lower castes; the prasada con-

secrated to the gods purifies all worshippers who receive it; and the remains of the husband's meal purify the wife.110 
Tryambaka's next statement, together with its supporting quota- tion from Manu, concerns the wife's offering to the goddess Jyesthā. I shall deal with this later (see below, pp.227-9). Here, I shall proceed with the other rulings relating to the wife's own meal. 
A third point concerning this topic is that 'the patni should avoid all food, drink and so on that her husband does not eat.'111 According to Vyasa, 'the chaste wife (sati) should avoid everything that her husband does not drink, eat or (in any way) consume (e.g. betel, etc.).'112 Like Gāndhārī who, by blindfolding herself, chose not to see what her blind husband could not see (Mbh.I.110.14), the ideal wife should not even taste what her husband cannot or will not eat. Even at the beginning of the twentieth century, this was both the ideal and the practice of the more orthodox households (LSJ). For, as previously noted, it was believed that the perfect wife grew to be more and more like her husband until eventually she merged with him as the river merges with the sea (Manu IX.22; cf. above, pp.34-9, 156–7).

110. This custom has continued in traditional India well into the twentieth century. My own teacher, Tarkatīrtha Lakshmanshastri Joshi (now in his eighties), was married at the age of twenty-six to a girl of fourteen. Since his own mother had died, the female head of the joint household was his elder brother's twenty-two-year-old wife: it was her duty to teach the new bride how to behave. As a result, both women served food to their husbands at meal-times, always making sure that they had far more on their plates than they could possibly eat. When the men had finished, each wife ate what was left on her own husband's plate. Not until Lakshmanshastri Joshi took over his teacher's pathaśālā some distance away, and so set up a separate estab- lishment there, did he feel able to give his wife a separate plate and her own food. Two things are of interest here: first, that in this particular household the custom was enforced not by a man but by a woman, and one so young; secondly, that although Lakshmanshastri Joshi did not like the custom, he did not consider opposing the views of the gṛhamukhi, though she was younger than him by several years and he was a well-established scholar who had completed the full term of Vedic studies. According to Lynn Bennett, this practice is still in force in Nepal (1983:174).

A fortiori, 'the (good) wife should not eat (tasty or especially) wholesome food while neglecting (to serve them to) her husband.'113 A quotation attributed to ‘Skanda' explains. 'If a woman neglects her husband while she alone eats wholesome food, then she will be (reborn as) a village sow or a female bat that eats its own excre- ment.'114 Clearly, if a woman eats only what is left on her hus- band's plate, there is little danger that this might happen. Since the hog eats all the village refuse and excrement and is commonly known by names deriving from this fact (e.g vitcara, vidvaraha), the last epithet may refer to it as well as to the bat. We may also note that threats of this kind always specify a female animal for a female offender: not only is it normal for a woman to retain her gender in transmigration (cf. Manu XII.72; Sdhp.39v.10-40r.1, from section IV, p.188), but a female is always a step below the male in the scale of births. This point is discussed in more detail in section III on the inherent nature of women. 
Tryambaka's final point regarding the wife's meal is that 'she should not eat while her husband is watching.'115 According to a śloka attributed to Vyasa, 'she should not do any of the following things when her husband is watching: eating, vomiting, sleeping, getting dressed or making herself beautiful.'116 This is the second of two slokas, both attributed to Vyasa, that are dealt with earlier in Tryambaka's subsection on getting dressed in the morning (section IIA, pp.95-6, note 72). Similar rulings may be found else- where. Manu IV.43, for example, rules that a man should not look at his wife when she is eating, sneezing, yawning or sitting at ease (āsīnām yathāsukham). Gaut.IX.9.32 specifies not looking at a woman who is anointing her body with oil (cf. Har.). 
The Satapathabrāhmaṇa gives one reason why the husband should

eat apart from his wife (Śat.Br.X.5.2.9; see above, pp.214-17), and quite another for why the wife should eat apart from her husband. As is explained in the section on offerings made to the wives of the gods (patnīsamyāga), one should conceal such offerings and the fire from the sight of the male gods. If one does not do this, the gods will expect to receive those offerings themselves and so will be disappointed. The verse concludes: and this is why Yajña- valkya says that on earth too women should eat apart from men (Śat.Br.I.9.2.12). 
I now return to the rulings omitted earlier concerning the wife's equivalent to her husband's pre-dinner ritual (bhojanavidhí). 'Women should make an offering of food (balidānam) to the goddess Jyestha at the time of their own meal.'117 The following two slokas are attributed to Manu. 'The woman who does not make a daily food-offering (bali) to Jyestha, according to her resources, from the food she is about to eat, will go to hell when she dies. Women who want sons, grandsons and wealth should propitiate Jyestha with a food-offering (balikarman) every day without fail.'118 
It is important to distinguish between three separate rituals here. First, the 'great sacrifice' (mahāyajña) in which morsels of food are offered to all beings (balikarman, bhūtayajña; e.g. Āp.II.2.3.18ff.; PVK II.ii.pp.745ff.; cf. above, pp.176-8), is performed by men at the same time as the vaisvadeva ritual. Secondly, the simple offering of morsels of food beside one's plate as a formality before eating (baliharana) is performed by men as part of the bhojanavidhi. Thirdly, women are required to make their own formal offering of morsels of food to the goddess Jyeṣṭhā (balidānam) before they too may eat. By using the term balikarman for the women's ritual, it is being deliberately raised to the level of the rituals performed by men. This is in keeping with the high moral tone with which the duties of women are described in this treatise. 
Jyestha, literally 'eldest', is the goddess of misfortune, personi-

fied as the elder sister of Laksmi or Śrī, the goddess of beauty and prosperity. According to some accounts of the myth of the great churning of the ocean by the gods and demons, Jyestha was born from the poison swallowed by Siva (e.g. Pad.P.VI.260.22-3). Ac- cording to the Lingapurāna (II.6.2ff.), she emerged from the ocean when it was churned for the second time (v.4). Jyestha (also called Alakṣmi, 'misfortune') represents the darker side of creation. As the Lingapurāna explains, in order to delude mankind (mohanāya), Visnu made the universe twofold (jagaddvaidham idam cakre). The good half (dharma) comprised the brahmins, the Vedas, and the goddess Śrī (v.3); the bad half (adharma) comprised wicked or inferior men (aśubhān), those outside the Vedas (veda[b]āhyān) and the goddess Jyesṭhā (v.4). The latter dwells far from the path of the Vedas (v.17,27) and is always present wherever husband and wife quarrel (yatra bhartă ca bhārya ca parasparavirodhinau; v.31) and wherever false mendicants (bhikṣu[b]imba; i.e. heretics), naked Jains (kṣapanaka) or Buddhists (bauddha) are found (v.54). Ac- cording to the myth, Jyestha married a sage who found her so irreli- gious and antisocial that he abandoned her in such a place where local divinities were worshipped and heretical (i.e. non-Vedic) rituals were performed. Instructing her to support herself on the offerings made by women devotees (v.79), the sage left her there. Eventually, Jyesthā repented of her ways and turned to Visnu for help. 
Throughout his treatise, Tryambaka insists that the orthodox wife should worship no deity other than her husband. It is interest- ing, therefore, that the only exceptions he allows are the two sister goddesses, Śrī (Lakṣmi) and Jyesthā (Alakṣmī). I have discussed briefly the ambivalent attitudes evident in stories about Śrī and the negative associations carefully glossed over by Tryambaka (see section IIA, pp.60-3). Jyeṣṭhā presents an even more ambivalent image of and for the Hindu wife. Indeed, the resonances between the goddess and her namesake in orthodox society-the jyestha or senior wife in the polygamous household-are particularly striking. As the older wife-perhaps superseded by a younger one chosen for her beauty rather than according to ritual requirements— the goddess is usually portrayed as a woman of unappealing face and solid proportions. An ornate hair-style, costly ornaments, and the tilaka on her forehead indicate her good fortune in that her husband is still alive (cf. section IIA, pp.96-101). She is flanked

by two attendants, described in the texts as her son and daughter, and so has evidently earned the respect due to the mother of her husband's ritual heir. While the crow on her banner and the donkey ascribed to her in some texts are clearly inauspicious, the broom- stick is both a tool and a weapon.119 In fact, this highly ambivalent image combines many of the major themes relating to the high- caste senior wife: domestic concerns; ritual inferiority; and yet the acknowledged power in the home. As the goddess of 'inferior' people who lack Vedic initiation and ritual, Jyestha is the obvious recipient of the worship of women. But the offering of food by orthodox (yet uninitiated) women to such a goddess presents a marked contrast with the equivalent offerings made by their initiated husbands (cf. Leslie 1984). 
Tryambaka finally considers what the good wife should do after her meal (bhojanānantarakrtyam). A general rule, presumably applicable to both men and women, is attributed to Sandilya. 'After washing both hands with either earth or something like ground māṣa beans, and after washing one's knees and feet, one should clean one's teeth with twigs.'120 Māṣa beans are a common food today (considered heavy and hard to digest; Meulen beld 1974:194), but in earlier times they were also used as a cleansing agent (cf. Gode 1969:163, Apar.). (The question of the twigs to be used for cleaning one's teeth is discussed in section IIA, pp.78-82). 
'Then,' according to the Smṛtyarthasara, ‘after washing one's hands, one should drop (water) into one's eyes by letting it trickle from (the ends of) one's fingers. Then one should touch one's eyes (i.e. wipe them), sip water, and contemplate one's personal deity

(istadevatā).'121 The act of dropping water into the eyes after a meal is both a ritual and a medical requirement. For the fingers used are those one has been eating with and the traces of food left on them (after washing) are believed to have healing qualities. The term upasparśana can mean touching something with water as a form of ablution but it is used in this context to denote the acamana ritual described earlier (pp.75-7). For even today it is the custom of orthodox men or initiated boys (e.g. in a traditional pāṭhaśālā) to eat, wash hands, drop water into the eyes, and then sit with their hands 'between their knees' (antarjānu; cf. section IIC, p.75) to do the sipping ritual (LSJ). The implication here is that women should do this too. 
The next set of rulings describes the process of clearing away and washing up; these are also couched in the masculine. Attributed to Āpastamba, they are taken from the Apastambadharmasūtra section on the duties of the householder. (Any particles left) where it (the meal) has been eaten should be swept up and taken away, and the area should be sprinkled with water. Then one should scrape the traces of food from the vessels, wash (the vessels) with water, and take them to a clean (or pure) place to the north for Rudra. In this way, the home becomes auspicious (subham) (again), '122 
To clarify this, Tryambaka gives Haradatta's commentary on the sutra, interspersed with what seem to be comments of his own. The explanation runs as follows. 'Yatra (implies sthāne and thus) means "in the place where food is eaten”. “One should sweep it up" means one should gather the left-overs in that place into a pile with a broom and take them elsewhere. When one has taken them out, one should sprinkle the area with water. After sprinkling it with water, then from those vessels, that is, those in which the cooking was done

at the time123—and on this subject (Tryambaka interjects), Amara declares that bhānda, pātra, amatra and bhäjana all mean "con- tainer" 124 — from them one should scrape the "traces", that is, the traces of food and condiments. Then one should wash (the vessels) with water. Then one should take (the vessels) to a clean place to the north, that is, of the house, saying "Let this be for Rudra; "125 or (Tryambaka interjects), according to another work, saying “May homage be to Rudra."126 In this way, the home becomes auspicious (śivam), that is, it becomes prosperous. This is the meaning (of the sūtrā), '127 
Although neither Apastamba nor Tryambaka specify that this process of cleaning up should be done by the wife or the women of the household, in the context of Tryambaka's treatise this is the obvious interpretation. As Tryambaka explains below, washing up after the midday meal is one of the major domestic duties the wife must complete before sunset. The sprinkling of water in the place where food has been eaten indicates both a physical cleansing of the area and a ritual purification. Indeed, Vidyārṇava warns that this cleansing of both the vessels used and the place of eating is essential for the ritual purity of all concerned: 'for a man is not really puri- fied so long as these are not cleansed' (1979:165). 
The wife's final post-prandial duty is to prepare betel. Two unattributed slokas explain. 'After eating, while sitting at one's

ease, (one should prepare) something cleansing for the mouth using betel, and something cleansing (for the system) using one of the essential ingredients such as the sunthi root or the amalaka fruit. Then one should offer a good areca nut and a good leaf with powder- ed lime on it to the brahmins (i.e. guests) and to the gods; and after that one may chew betel (oneself).'128 In a medical context, sodhana (translated here as 'something cleansing') denotes medicine that removes bad humours (Meulenbeld 1974:511). In particular, śunthi (usually translated as 'dried ginger'129) and betel are taken to stimulate the digestion (Meulenbeld 1974:462-3; 474–5). Since it is the wife's duty to prepare all the items necessary for the gods in the devapujā ritual (including food and betel), and to prepare food for and serve her husband, his guests and family, we may assume that it is also her job to prepare and serve the items for refreshment and digestion after the meal (cf. Sinha 1980:126–7). We should also note, however, that since the use of betel is also deemed to make a woman attractive (see section IIA, pp. 96–7), it is forbidden to the menstruating woman, the woman whose hus- band is away, and the widow (see section IV, pp.284–5, 291, 299– 300). 
According to Daksa, one should spend the rest of the afternoon (i.e. the sixth and seventh parts of an eightfold day) allowing one's meal to digest while listening to recitals of the epics and purānas (Dakṣa II.61-9; cf. pp.45-9). According to Yajñ.1.113, the rest of the day (ahaḥśeṣam; i.e. until sunset) should be spent in the company of learned men (siṣṭaiḥ; glossed by Mit. as itihāsapurānā- divedibiḥ), those one likes (istaih; glossed by Mit. as kavyakathā- prapancacaturaiḥ, 'those skilled in acting out scenes from drama and narrative'), and one's own relatives. It seems clear from Bāṇa's account in the Kadambarī, for example, that these pleasures were also available to royal or court women such as queen Vilāsavatī (anavaratavācyamānāḥ punyakathāḥ śuśrāva; Kād.p.135). As I have suggested in my introduction, perhaps Tryambaka's

own treatise was intended to be read aloud to the court women and expounded upon during this afternoon siesta (see pp.22-3, 49). Tryambaka, however, mentions no such activity. Instead, he lists all the household tasks that the wife should dispatch before sunset. 
'Cleaning the house (a second time), washing the pots (after the midday meal), and gathering together all the paraphernalia (re- quired for the evening rituals)-these tasks should definitely be done before sunset because they are necessary for the vaisvadeva, atithi and other rituals which should be performed in the evening. But the pounding of rice should not be done at sunset (a second time).'130 Tryambaka quotes a sloka attributed to the Märkandeya- purāna. 'If a woman in her ignorance cleans rice and so on when the sun has set, she will be barren in life after life.'131 On the other hand, also according to the Märkandeyapurana, 'it is wrong not to clean the house in the evening: if a woman fails to do the cleaning at sunset, she will be without husband and property in life after life.'132 
Despite the apparent confusion about the timing of these tasks, there seem to be two points. First, the preparation of rice (cleaning, pounding, etc.) should be done only once a day, before dawn. Secondly, other household tasks such as sweeping and cleaning the house, should be done both morning (i.e. before dawn) and evening (i.e. before sunset). Similarly, the washing of pots and pans after the midday meal and the preparations for the evening ritual should all be completed before sunset. In this way, both home and wife will be in a fit state for the evening ritual and the evening meal. As we shall see, the preparations for the evening rituals presuppose the preparation of food as well.

IID Evening (Sdhp. 19v.4-21r.3) 
The considerably shorter section relating to the wife's duties in the evening may be divided into two main groups. First, Tryambaka deals briefly with the evening equivalents of morning rituals and tasks: the evening agnihotra, paying respect to one's elders, the vaiśvadeva ritual and bali offerings, paying homage to guests, and the evening meal (Sdhp.19v.4-20r.4). Secondly, he gives several rulings regarding sexual intercourse at night (sayanam; Sdhp. 20r.4-21r.2). 
On the question of whether the wife need be present at the evening agnihotra ritual as well as at the morning one, opinions differ. Tryambaka explains that, according to Baudhāyana, 'the wife's presence at the evening ritual is necessary." The first part of the sūtra quoted is also given in Tryambaka's section on the morning fire ritual (section IIB, p.130, note 26). "The chief wife (patnī) should be present at the evening and the morning (sacrifice).' The rest of the sutra adds that ‘some say (she should be present) every evening.' Tryambaka concludes that ‘in that case, there would be no rule (requiring the patni's presence) for the morning (ritual).'2 
The second ritual duty to be performed by the wife each evening is that of paying respect to her elders (cf. section IIC, pp.156–68). According to the Smṛtiratna, 'such things as paying respect to one's elders and homage to guests should be done (in the evening) as (they are) in the morning.'3 The quotation is given in the masculine. '(In the evening) as in the morning (lit. daytime), one who has performed the fire ritual, paid homage to his elders and, according to his resources, offered hospitality to guests may perform the vaisvadeva and bali rituals and then eat.'4

Tryambaka continues. 'The cooking for the vaiśvadeva ritual should also be done in the evening (a second time).' The quota- tion that follows is attributed to Visnu. ‘O king, in the evening as well (as in the morning), one should take freshly cooked food and, together with one's wife, make bali offerings at the time of the vaiśvadeva ritual.'5 The quotation is precisely as given in both the Parāśaramādhavīya and the Smṛticandrika. In the Visnupurāṇa, however, which all three claim to quote, it is the patni who should take the freshly cooked food and make the bali offerings, but without mantras (patny amantram). Tryambaka makes this point next, with an important proviso. 'In the evening (lit. “at night"), if the husband is not there, the vaisvadeva and bali offerings may also be performed by the patni, but without mantras.'6 He quotes Manu. "The patni should make the bali offering using food prepared in the evening, without mantras.'7 But neither Manu nor his commenta- tors stipulate that the husband should be away before this ruling comes into effect. The second half of Manu's sloka merely explains that the vaisvadeva ritual, and therefore the bali offerings too, are prescribed for both morning and evening. According to Tryam- baka, however, the patni may only substitute for her husband when the latter is away; otherwise she should assist as usual. Either way, she should prepare fresh food for the evening ritual. 
Tryambaka next deals with the ritual hospitality to guests which, according to the Visnupurana, should be observed before the evening meal as well as before the midday one (cf. section IIC, pp. 183-210). In fact, the ritual is of even greater importance in the

evening than at midday. The quotation reads as follows. "The wise man should honour any guest who comes (to his house) according to his own resources. He should bid him welcome, O Pārthiva, and honour him, bowing down as he offers him water to wash his feet and a seat, and then (he should honour him) by offering food and a bed. O king, whatever sin accrues to men when a daytime guest turns his back and leaves (unfed), that same (sin) increases eight- fold when he turns his back and leaves (unfed) once the sun has set.'8 The idea that the evening meal is of greater ritual importance than the midday meal no doubt follows from the fact that the evening agnihotra is the primary part of the twofold fire ritual, cf, agni- suśruṣa; section IIB, pp.102-7). On the practical level, of course, it is also harsher to turn a stranger away at night. 
Finally, Tryambaka considers the evening meal itself. According to Sandilya, 'the householder should eat at night that which is benefi- cial, wholesome and very satisfying." Clearly, Tryambaka's treat- ment of evening rituals and duties tells us little more than that these activities should be performed in the evening much as they are in the morning or at midday. 
Tryambaka begins his subsection on going to bed (śayanam) with a quotation from the Smṛtyarthasara. 'After performing the vaiśva- deva oblation (homa) and offering hospitality to guests, after eating a light meal surrounded by one's dependants, then, making (full) use of sweet-smelling unguents, garlands, betel and so on, one

should sleep with one's wife.'10 The Pune edition of the Smṛtyar- thasara emphasizes that a man should sleep with his own wife (svastriyā saha). The statement that a man should eat 'surrounded by his dependants' seems somewhat at odds with the rulings men- tioned earlier concerning the ritual importance of privacy at meals or at least of eating only with those of similar rank (section IIC, pp.214-17). We must therefore assume the formal separation of diners by, for example, powder designs on the ground between them (cf. ekapankti; p.221). 
Tryambaka gives the ruling for the wife. 'Only after she has paid homage (namaskṛtya) to her husband's feet may she go to bed.'11 This statement is supported by a sloka attributed to Vyāsa. ‘After paying homage to her husband's feet, she should go to bed. Treat- ing her beloved in a way that gives him pleasure (ahladasamyuktam kṛtvā), she should engage in sexual intercourse (samyogam acaret; i.e. she should make love to him).’12 
This ruling, with its emphasis on the initiative of the wife, recalls the view mentioned earlier that the ideal woman is all things to her husband: mother, sister, friend, slave and lover (pp.213–14). In fact, according to the writers of manuals on sexual love, the women of Maharashtra were considered especially pro- ficient in the erotic arts and prepared to take the initiative them- selves (sakalacatuḥṣaṣṭiprayogarāginyaḥ; Kām.II.5.29). There is, of course, the common (male) belief that the sexuality of women is greater than that of men and their need for intercourse conse- quently more imperative (e.g. Carstairs 1971:73). The negative consequences of this are discussed at some length in section III (pp.246-72) on the inherent nature of women. According to the theorists, wives are of three basic kinds: very young and therefore extremely shy in sexual matters (mugdha, ‘artless'; navoḍhā, 'newly married'; Randhawa 1962: plate II); somewhat more ad- vanced and less inhibited (madhyama or madhya); and, best of all, the mature wife who is confident of her own sexuality (praudhā; 
for atithyam ca; bhuñjīta for laghu bhuktvā; tataḥ svastriya for striyā; su- gandhalepanatambulādi for sugandhānulepanamalyatāmbūlādi).

Randhawa 1962: plate III; Bahadur 1972: 26ff.). In his section on general behaviour, Tryambaka himself advocates a bold confi- dence in sexual matters (prāgalbhyam kāmakaryeṣu, Sdhp. 22v.4; section IV, pp.273-4; cf. plates 12, 13). 
Following the scribal notations on MS T1, I shall take the Baudhayana quotation next. It describes the scene from the hus- band's point of view. 'Then he should take her into a beautiful room that has been well washed and smeared with cow-dung; (a room that is) perfumed, decked with flowers, incense, lights and a bed; a place where they will not be disturbed; (one that is) illuminated in the (four) directions by means of wicks placed in ghee; (one that has) above (the head of the bed) a jar of water and a mirror. In such a place, he should make love to her.'13 
Paintings depicting the scene show most of the items listed here. For example, one of the many classifications of women includes the wife who expects her husband or lover to return at any moment and who waits at the door with the bed prepared (vāsakasajjā; Bahadur 1972:114). The paintings show a private room carefully arranged with a bed and cushions (Randhawa 1962; figs.36,37,39), garlands of flowers (figs.37,39), lighted candles in each of the four directions (fig.39, plate XIII), containers for such things as sandalwood paste, perfumed unguents and betel (figs.36,39), and a water-pot at the head of the bed (figs.36,39; cf. Sm.M.II.p.457; Sm.C.II.p.629). In particular, sandalwood paste is used to cool and perfume the body, betel to sweeten the breath (cf. section IIA, pp.96-7). Scenes showing the delights of love-making (samyoga) also record many of the items prescribed by Baudhayana (e.g. Randhawa 1962: fig.76; plates III,IV,XIX). In the Kamasutra too, such a 'pleasure room' (ratyāvāsa) is described as decked with flowers and fragrant with perfumes (Kām.II.10.1). The mirror is a frequent addition to such scenes, either as an essential part of the toilet of either husband or wife (Randhawa 1962:45, figs. 14,28,49, plate X; Sinha 1980:123) or as a means of intensifying the experience of sexual union (Randhawa 1962:29, fig.6). Although Baudhāyana does not say so, it would presumably be the wife's job to prepare

the room and to gather the items required for love-making (as she does those for image worship; see section IIC, pp.178–80, notes 34-5). 
To avoid repetition, I have extended the passage transposed by the scribe of MS T, to include the following two sutras, also at- tributed to Baudhāyana. The first, attributed to the Baudhāyana- gṛhyaparibhāṣāsūtra, describes the preliminaries to love-making. "Then, when the sun has set, they adorn each other and lie down on the bed. Then he decks her with a garland (full) of all kinds of sweet fragrances.'14 According to the second sutra, attributed to the Baudhāyanagṛhyaseṣasutra, the husband should make love to (his wife) in the first half of the night; and from midnight to the brāhmamuhūrta (see section IIA, pp.51-2), sleeping on a low bed (or on the ground; adhaḥsayanam) (is enjoined).'15 
It is not clear whether the last of these rulings applies to both husband and wife or only to the wife. Judging by the many paintings depicting the place of love-making, a raised bed was common among the wealthier classes (Randhawa 1962: plates XIX,III; figs.21,37, 39). Tryambaka himself alludes to such a bed in his section on women's property. For the items that Sītā gives away before her departure into the forest include ‘a raised bed studded with jewels and covered with luxurious cushions' (paryankam agryāstaranam nānāratnavibhāṣitam, Sdhp.26[3]v.4-5; from section IV, pp.277-80). The term pāryanka denotes a particularly fine wooden four-poster (e.g. Sinha 1980:43,61,151,159). Such a bed is typical of wealthy or princely families, and examples may still be found in Indian palaces today. According to Tryambaka, neither the menstruating woman nor the widow is permitted to sleep on such a bed (see section IV, pp.284-5, 299-300). 
It seems unlikely that, after making love, both husband and wife would descend to the floor to sleep (cf. Randhawa 1962: plate III, depicting the entwined couple in what appears to be post-coital sleep, still on their raised bed). Perhaps Tryambaka's intention is

that the wife should leave her husband to sleep on the bed while she resorts to a mat on the floor. It is certainly customary in some rural areas today (e.g. in western Rajasthan) for the husband to sleep on a raised bed while his wife and family sleep on the floor (or on a low bed; cf. Chaki-Sircar 1984:98). In fact, the practice was fairly common among traditional families in Maharashtra earlier this century (LSJ). Moreover, dharmasastra rulings specify that the couple should only lie together during sexual intercourse (yavat samnipātam caiva sahaśayyā; Āp.II.1.1.21); once that is over, they should sleep separately (tato nānā, Āp.II.1.1.22; tataḥ prthak śayīyātām, Ujj., Benares edn.) and bathe (Ap.II.1.1.23;II.1.2. 1; Gaut.I.9.25; Manu V.144). 
Back in sequence once more, Tryambaka's next point is that 'she (the wife) should not sleep naked.'16 The subsequent quotation is attributed to Manu. 'They should make love, the man having removed his clothes, the woman without removing hers; if both remove their clothes, discord will enter (into them).'17 
This seems a surprising ruling, especially in view of the obvious nakedness of the woman in some of the paintings extolling sexual love (e.g. Plates 12, 13; cf. Randhawa 1962: plate III; Sinha 1980: 43, 45, 49, 51, etc.). It is also at odds with the ruling below that she should not keep her blouse on. Perhaps what is meant here is that, if she removes her clothes to make love, she should dress again to sleep. Āśv.gr.III.9.6, for example, rules that a man should not look at a naked woman except during sexual intercourse (na nagnām striyam īkṣetānyatra maithunāt). Certainly, it is customary for women even today to sleep in their saris. It was also the custom, especially in middle-class homes a generation or two ago, for the wife to wash and put on a clean sari after making love. (As a result, children amused themselves by noting whether the sari worn on emerging from the bedroom in the morning was the same as that worn on disappearing into it at night; LSJ.) However, although Tryambaka's own words may be interpreted in this way, the śloka he quotes may not. With regard to men, although (according to Tryambaka) they may re- move their clothes for love-making, they too should not sleep naked

(Ăśv.gr.III.9.6; Gaut.I.9.60; Manu IV.75; Viş.Sm.70.3; Sm.A. p. 70). 
A series of slokas attributed to Vyasa follow. Tryambaka intro- duces them by emphasizing the first ruling given. 'Sexual inter- course with one's husband should not be performed with wet feet.'18 The relevant śloka reads as follows. 'If a woman makes love with her husband when her feet are wet, she deprives her husband of long life and goes to hell herself.'19 This ruling is applied elsewhere to men as well as women. Manu VI.76, for example, rules that one should eat with one's feet still wet (i.e. from the purificatory sprinkling; ärdrapādas tu bhunjīta; cf. Vis.Sm.68.34) but one should not make love with wet feet (nārdrapādas tu samviset). ‘Make love' (samviśet) is glossed by the commentators as 'sleep' (sayīta, Sarv.; supyāt, Kull.; cf. närdrapadaḥ supyāt, Vis. Sm.70.1; Sm.A.p.70, etc.). However, paintings of Rādhā having her wet feet dried by a maid- servant (e.g.Randhawa 1962: plate X) are obviously more piquant if the first meaning is assumed. On these grounds, I suspect that the young bride described by Sinha (1980:123) as having her feet massaged is in fact having her wet feet properly dried. 
The next two ślokas (also attributed to Vyāsa) return to the subject of the wife's attire. ‘If a woman makes love with her hus- band while wearing a bodice, she will certainly be a widow in three years or even sooner. If a woman (dayitā; lit. "beloved") makes love with the "palm-leaf" type of earrings (talapattra) dangling from her ears, she will be a widow in this life within five or seven years, '20 
The reasons for both rulings seem self-evident. Regarding the first, we may recall the earlier requirement that a woman should always cover her breasts (section IIA, p.90, note 69). The rule that she should remove her bodice for love-making reinforces the idea that women of this class usually wore bodices in public. In Tryambaka's circles at least, it seems that a woman's naked breasts

were more likely to be associated with sexual intimacy than with fashion or custom. 
A glance through paintings depicting high-class men and women will demonstrate their fondness for ornaments. Women in parti- cular wore elaborate earrings, nose-rings and hair ornaments (e.g. Randhawa 1962: plates VII, XI, figs. 11,68; cf. Śahendravilāsa V. 33-42,VI.216). Even the naked woman pictured in her husband's embrace wears a mass of jewellery at her wrists, ankle and throat, in her nose and ears, and on her forehead (e.g. plates 12, 13; cf. Ran- dhawa 1962: plate III). The 'palm-leaf" earring-also mentioned in the Kādambarī (Kād. II.28; MW 1976:445)—is evidently a parti- cularly large, pendent ornament that might impede the intimacy of lovers. 
The next sloka (also attributed to Vyasa) deals with the lifting of certain important prohibitions for the duration of love-making. 'Allowing one's body to touch (lit. "cling to") the (other's) feet, (eating the other's) left-overs (ucchiṣṭam), blows, anger, rage and reproaches-in love-making, none of these is wrong.'21 
As explained earlier, touching someone's feet is a formal gesture made by an inferior to his or her superior (gurūṇām abhivādanam; section IIC, pp.157-60). While it is proper for a wife to touch her husband's feet, therefore, the reverse is unthinkable except in the special context of love-making. Lifting this prohibition makes all kinds of intimacies possible: from the man throwing himself at the woman's feet in an extravagant gesture of adulation (pädapatanam, Kām.III.2.11; cf. Upadhyaya 1981: plate XXVIII) to a variety of otherwise impossible positions for sexual intercourse (Kām.II.6.1 ff.). Paintings even show the woman touching the man's head with her foot as a form of rebuke if, for example, he mentions another woman's name (Upadhyaya 1961: plate XLIIa; Sinha 1980:91). 
Similarly, eating the left-overs of someone else's meal (ucchistam) is a sign of one's own humility in relation to that other person. Again, while it is proper for the wife to eat her husband's left-overs, the reverse is normally condemned (cf. pp.221-7). Lifting this pro- hibition allows not only eating from the same dish (as at the time of marriage) but also the intimacies of drinking wine or taking food directly from the lover's mouth (e.g. vadanena tāmbuladānam; Kam.III.2.12).

243 
With regard to physical blows, it is generally agreed that a hus- band may beat his wife if she has done something wrong (e.g. Manu VIII.299-300; but not on the head or chest, Medh. and Kull. on Manu VIII.300). The reverse is inconceivable. In contrast, a woman must control her thoughts, words and actions (manovāgdehasam- yată, Manu V.165,166; cf. Gaut.I.9.3; Yajñ.I.87). She should never answer back even when she is scolded (äkruṣṭāpi na cākrośet) nor show her anger or resentment even when she is beaten (tāditāpi prasīdati, Sdhp.23r.4-5, from section IV, pp.273-4; cf.Sk.P.III. 2.7.18) or if her husband takes another wife (Manu IX.83). In love- making, such prohibitions are swept aside. As a result, the manuals on the art of love have produced detailed classifications of the permitted types of scratching (Kām.II.4), biting (Kām.II.5) and striking (Kām.II.7). Sexual intercourse becomes an erotic 'quarrel'; striking one's partner a sign of passion. Vätsyāyana's description of 'love quarrels' (pranayakalaha) is to the point: when a woman is (or pretends to be) jealous, a great quarrel arises; she cries, becomes angry, strikes her lover, pulls his hair, kicks him repeatedly on his arms, head, chest and back, and rebukes him with harsh and re- proachful words (Kām.II.10.40-6). Indeed, it is said that lovers in the throes of passion are impervious to pain (Kām.II.7.1ff.). These elements are frequently recorded in poetry and art. For example, the eight types of lady-love (nāyikā) include the woman who, having quarrelled with her lover, sends him away (abhisandhită or kala- hāntaritā; cf. Randhawa 1962: fig.40); and the one who reproaches her lover bitterly for sleeping with another woman (khaṇḍitā; cf. Randhawa 1962: fig.42). Tryambaka's point is that such behaviour, normally forbidden to the good and submissive wife, is acceptable in the privacy of making love. 
The next sloka, also attributed to Vyasa, reads as follows. 'Kunkuma, collyrium, haldi power (haridrā) and sandalwood paste, clean clothes and betel-each brings happiness (and is therefore auspicious) in love-making. '22 The ointments, powders and pastes— all mentioned in Tryambaka's section on getting dressed in the morning (IIA, pp.96-7), constitute the signs of the happily married woman. Clearly, the ideal wife will be as carefully dressed and perfumed for the evening as she is at the beginning of the day (see plates 2-5).

According to Vātsyāyana, she will come to the 'pleasure room' freshly bathed and dressed (Kām.II.10.1). After they have made love, they will each go separately to wash, returning to chew betel together and to apply ointments to each other's bodies (Kām.II. 10.13-14). 
Tryambaka's last point, both in this section and in his treatment of daily duties as a whole, is to lift one more prohibition for the purpose of love-making. 'There is nothing wrong in wearing dark blue (nila) clothes when making love.'23 
This relates to a prohibition that is normally couched in the masculine and therefore apparently applies to men. As I have already shown in the section on getting dressed, the male snātaka is repeatedly enjoined to wear white garments and not dyed ones (raktam, Gaut.I.9.5; sarvān rāgān vāsasi, Āp.I.11.30.10). Āp.I.11. 30.11 also prohibits cloth that is naturally black (krṣnam ca svā- bhāvikam; such as kambala, a kind of woollen cloth, Ujj.). Dark blue cloth, that is, cloth dyed with indigo (nīlam, nīlīraktam) is both specified for sūdras and forbidden to higher varnas (see section IIA, p.89). 
Tryambaka's quotation is attributed to Apastamba. ‘If a brah- min puts on his body a garment that has been dyed dark blue, he must sit day and night (without eating) and then purify himself by (drinking) pañcagavya.'24 The purifying properties of pañcagavya are discussed in section IIA (pp.59-60). A later sloka from the Āpastambasmṛti, not given by Tryambaka, adds that if one sits down to eat while wearing blue garments, one must undergo the cändră- yaṇa fast (Āp.Sm.VI.8). Tryambaka merely gives the exception. "There is no sin attached to women (wearing dark blue garments) in bed during love-making just for fun. '25 
This suggests that the prohibition regarding dark blue clothes normally applies to both men and women but, for women, it no longer applies during love-making. Certainly, women are portrayed in both poetry and art wearing dark blue as they emerge from the

bedroom in the morning (e.g. Randhawa 1962:186, plate XX, cf. plate III). The associations attached to the colour presumably reinforce the intimacy of the scene. The idea that this same sari should not be worn during the day recalls a similar rule for men in the Apastambadharmasutra: one should come together (for sexual intercourse) when wearing a garment (reserved) for (making love to) women (strīvāsasaiva samnipātaḥ syāt, Ap.II.1.1.20; glossed by Ujj. as stryupabhogartham vasaḥ; by Sm.M.I.p.77 as strīsam- yogārthavāsasā). As the Ujjvalā explains, the issue here is that one should wear the right thing at the right time (evakaro bhinnakra- mah). Thus one should not wear the garment one makes love in when performing sacrificial ritual and so on during the day (na tena ... brahmayajñādi kṛtyam). In principle, this ruling would seem to apply to women as well as men. 
Having produced rulings for almost every activity in a woman's day, from the moment she wakes in the morning to the garments she should wear at night, Tryambaka finally brings this lengthy and detailed section to a close. 'These are the daily duties (of women).'26

III. The Inherent Nature of Women 
(strīsvabhāvaḥ; Sdhp.21r.3-22r.8)1 
After instructing the virtuous wife on her duties throughout the day, Tryambaka turns to face the objection most likely to under- mine his whole project. The problem is simple but devastating. If women are inherently wicked, as they are traditionally supposed to be, then how can they possibly have any interest in learning what Tryambaka is at such pains to teach them? Why does he bother to teach women at all? Tryambaka puts this question in the form of a pūrvapakṣa. The problem is (nanu), how can there be any (real) inclination towards receiving religious instruction (°dharmaśravaṇe) as described (by me above) on the part of women who are by nature corrupted (svabhāvato duṣṭānām strīṇām)? For the inherent faults of women (strīṇām svabhāvikadoṣā[h]) are widely recognized."2 
Tryambaka does not spell out the traditional argument for the inherent sinfulness of women; but it is clearly assumed. In his section on snāna, for example, he rules that twice-born men should perform the bathing ritual with mantras (mantravat), sūdras and women without (tūṣṇīm; section IIA, p.83, note 60; cf. Manu II. 66-7, IX.18; Yajñ.I.13; Baudh.I.5.11.7, II.2.3.46). Since being born a woman or a sudra is the result of particular sins in a pre- vious birth,3 the mere fact of femaleness is seen as the proof of sin. Being sinful, a woman is amantravat; being amantravat, she cannot purify herself of sin; she therefore remains sinful all her life. It is quite logical, therefore, to attribute all manner of innate unpleasant- ness to women. 
The Jaina explanation for why the nineteenth Tirthankara was born a woman (Malli) makes this graphically clear. In her previous life, Malli was a king who, together with his friends, renounced the

world. They agreed to undertake the same number of fasts, but the king cheated (by claiming ill health, etc.) and so outdid his friends in austerity. Since he was otherwise without fault, he was reborn a Tirthankara; since he had cheated, he was reborn a woman. Such faults as cheating, deviousness, greed and cunning are widely agreed to be the cause of a female birth (cf. Jñatṛdharmakathāsūtra viii; cited Jaini 1979:39-40, note 93). 
More commonly, however, an individual retains his or her gender in transmigration. For example, threats involving rebirth at a lower level in the hierarchy of births always specify a female animal for a female offender (e.g. section IIC, p.226, note 114; Sdhp.39v.10-40r.1, from section IV, p.288; Manu XII,72, etc.). In similes (in kāvya, etc.), it is also unusual to cross gender. Two conclusions may be drawn. First, since sinfulness is the mark of a female birth, the female of the species is always lower than the male. Secondly, so deeply ingrained is this sinfulness that it is more difficult for a female to be reborn as a male than it is for an animal to be reborn as a human. This is the scale of Tryambaka's problem. If sinfulness is natural to women, and so powerful in its effect in life after life, then how can mere religious instruction help? 
Tryambaka begins by collecting evidence for the pūrvapakṣa (i.e. the prima facie view) he hopes to demolish. The first three slokas, attributed to the Anusāsanaparvan of the Mahābhārata, are taken from Bhisma's discourse to Yudhisthira on the inherent nature of women (strīsvabhāvakathanam; Mbh.XIII.38-9). 'Women are inherently fickle (calasvabhāvā[h]), difficult to manage, and in their very nature (bhāvata [h]) difficult to understand; as (unintelligible as) the words of a wise man, so are women.'4 We may note in passing that here are the bad qualities of instability and fickleness attri- buted to the goddess Śrī by the cows; and hence their excuse for refusing her request (section IIA, pp.60-3). The second sloka involves a play on words: since māyā ('magic', 'trickery') is a femi- nine noun, it is taken to be female. 'The (cunning) tricks (māyā) of (the demons) Sambhara, Namuci, Bali and Kumbhīnasis too-

5. Sambhara and Namuci are asuras of the Dänava clan (Mbh. 1.59.11-12, 20-2); both were killed by Indra in the great war between the gods and the

all these they (i.e. wise men) know to be women (yoṣit[ah]; i.e. fe- male).' The third sloka is equally resounding. 'Ever since the five gross elements (were created), ever since the (three) worlds were created by the creator, ever since men and women (pramada[h]; lit. "seductive" or "wanton") were fashioned-ever since then there have been faults (doṣaḥ) in women (pramadāsu).”7 For the sake of consistency, the next half-sloka is taken out of sequence. For, despite the fact that Tryambaka includes it in a later passage attri- buted to the Rāmāyaṇa, this too belongs to Bhisma's discourse on women in the Mahabharata. '(On the one side of a balanced scale,) the edge of the razor, poison, snake(s) and fire; and on the other (i.e. equal to them), women.'8 
Tryambaka continues with two choice quotations from Manu's ninth chapter on the religious duties relating to men and women (strīpumdharma). According to Tryambaka's version of these oft- quoted lines, 'they (i.e. women) are innately (svabhāvataḥ) promis- cuous, fickle-minded, lacking in love, and unfaithful to their hus- bands even when closely guarded.'9 Furthermore, at the time of their creation, '(the original) Manu allocated to women (the habit of) lying and sitting around, (a love of) ornament, (indiscriminate) sexual desire, anger, meanness, treachery and bad conduct.'10 
asuras (Mbh.III.165.19–20; III.168.18–19). Bali is an asura of the daitya clan (Mbh.I.59.11-12,20); he too was defeated by Indra in the great war (Mbh. III.165.15; III.168.20); he was also conquered by Visnu in the form of a dwarf (Mbh.III.100.21; III.299.13). There is no other reference to Kumbhi- nasi in the Mahābhārata.

The Inherent Nature of Women 
249 
Tryambaka's third and last source of quotations derogatory to women is the Rāmāyaṇa. These are culled from three separate episodes. First, Queen Kausalya's lament to Sītā before the latter's departure to the forest with Rāma includes the bitter complaint that 'the hearts of women do not care for (good) family, (good) deeds, wisdom, gifts, or even affection, for their hearts are incon- stant.'11 In context, of course, Kausalya's words compliment Sītā, whose devotion to Rāma even in adversity places her so far above the common run of women. Sītā goes further still, and begs Kausalya not even to associate her with such wicked women.12 The next two ślokas are taken from the sage Agastya's words to Rama before he advises the prince to settle in Pañcavațī. Again Sītā's behaviour is contrasted with that of ordinary women. For, according to Agastya, 'this has been the nature of women (ever) since creation (began): they cling to him who prospers and abandon him who runs into difficulty.'13 'For women take after (i.e. model themselves on) the fickleness of lightning flashes, the sharpness of weapons, and the speed of Garuda and the wind.'14 In the Rāmāyaṇa episode, Agastya, having made his point, exonerates Sītā from all such blame.15 Tryambaka simply quotes further criticisms of women, this time as spoken by the female ascetic Anasuyā (wife of the sage, Atri) to Sītā. She too compliments Sītā by denigrating the women who refuse to behave as she does. 'For wicked women — who do not know right from wrong in this way, and who, although dependent on their husbands for protection (bhartṛnāthā[ḥ]), wander about with their hearts subject (only) to their own desires-(such women,) O Maithili, incur disgrace and a fall from dharma.'16 In the context of Anasuya's advice to Sītā, these words describe the

behaviour and fate of bad women, not the inherent nature of women in general. Out of context, as presented by Tryambaka, the im- plication is that such is the behaviour of the majority of women. 
Tryambaka ends with a well-known sloka on the fate in store for women who indulge their evil tendencies. 'By their breach of con- duct, women who behave badly (durvṛttah) cause their three families—of father, mother and husband-to fall, bringing them misfortune both in this world (disgrace) and in the next (bad karma).'17 
Tryambaka concludes his case for the innate wickedness of women by directing us to his own voluminous commentary on the Rāmāyaṇa, the Dharmākūta, where, he tells us, 'further examples (of this kind) are to be found.'18 (For a brief discussion of the authorship of the Dharmakūta, see pp.10-13.) 
The argument is resumed once more. 'If, as a result of hearing in this way about the multiplicity of faults (attributed to women), someone were to ask how women could (possibly) have any incli- nation towards religious duty, then the answer is (twofold): be- cause it is understood from the words of Manu and others that they (women) have such qualities as inherent purity (tāsām svabhāvika- śucitvādi guṇānām avagamāt); and because it is also understood from the words of the Visnupurana that women are inherently blessed with good fortune (strīṇām svabhāvato dhanyatvāvagamād api).'19 Before dealing with the specific quotations provided by Tryambaka, I shall consider in more general terms the first of his two assertions. 
In ascribing purity to women, Tryambaka takes the bull by the horns. For it is precisely the impurity of women that is usually assumed. There are two major reasons for this. First, there is the impurity of menstruation (see section IV, pp.283-4). This is not merely one of the twelve impurities of the body (cf. Manu V.135), but the inescapable reminder of a woman's guilt.

The Inherent Nature of Women 
251 
Indra's brahminicide is told in the Taittiriyasamhita. When Indra kills Viśvarupa, he is condemned by the three worlds as a brahmin- killer. To escape the effects of this most heinous crime, he persuades the earth, trees and women to assume one-third of his guilt each. In return, he grants each a boon: the earth, when dug, will heal within one year; trees, when cut, will grow again; and women, un- like other animals, may enjoy sexual intercourse at any time (Tait. Sam.II.5.1 ff.), even in advanced pregnancy (cf. section IV, pp.288– 9). Indra's guilt took the form of fissures in the earth, sap in trees— hence one should avoid 'red secretions' and resin from cut trees (Manu V.6; cf. Tait.Sam.II.5.4)—and menstrual blood in women. In several variations on this theme, Indra distributes his brahmini- cide in four parts: among women, fire, trees and cows (Mbh.XII. 329.28-41); among rivers, mountains, earth and women (Mbh.V. 10-13); among trees, earth, women and water (Bhāg.P.VI.9.6-10). The constant recipient is women. In some texts, Indra's sin causes the recipients to become impure; in others, the recipients are already impure. For example, the guilt of Indra is offloaded onto 'foetus-killers' in the Atharvaveda (p.522ff.); onto sinful brahmins who serve śūdras and so on in the Skandapurāṇa (V.3.118.141); and onto those who kill brahmins in the Rāmāyaṇa (VIII.86.10-16). Menstruation, the sign of a woman's participation in brahmin- murder, is thus a mark of both her sexual appetite and her innate impurity (cf. O'Flaherty 1976:153ff.; for the symbolic ‘menstrual pollution' of rivers and the earth, see Salomon 1984:153ff., 175–6). 
Secondly, as women lost the right to Vedic education and upa- nayana (cf. Baudh.I.5.11.7; Manu IX.18; etc.), they were increasing- ly relegated to the level of the śūdra. For example, Manu gives the same rules of purification to women as to sūdras (V.139). Pace R.M. Das (1962:257), who claims that this verse illustrates the purity of women, what is important here is not that women only need to sip water once to become pure but that they are equated with śūdras (who also have to sip water once) and not with twice-born men (who must sip three times). 
Again and again, women are linked with other creatures whose only common quality is impurity. As early as the Satapathabrāh- maṇa, we learn that a woman, a sūdra, a dog and a crow are the embodiments of untruth, sin and darkness.20 Since the śūdra is the lowest of the four classes of men, whose touch defiles (cf. Āp. 
20. anṛtam strī śūdraḥ śvā kṛṣṇaḥ śakunis ...// Śat.Br.XIV.1.1.31. 
252 
Strīdharmapaddhati 
I.5.17.1 and Har. comm.), and since dogs and crows are always regarded as unclean (cf. Ap.I.5.15.16, I.5.16.30; Baudh.I.6.14.15; Viş.Sm.XXIII.38; etc.), the implication is that women too are impure. Even Manu's claim that a woman's mouth is always pure,21 so often quoted out of context (e.g. Das 1962:257), is something of a back-handed compliment (cf. Manu IV.208). For the verse clearly states the peculiar circumstances in which what is otherwise regarded as impure may be considered pure: a woman's mouth for the purpose of kissing (cumbanādau, paricumbanādau, Sarv., Rāgh., Medh. on Manu V.130; cumbanālinganādau, Nand. on Vis.Sm. XXIII.49); fruit that has fallen as a result of a bird (glossed as 'crows, etc.') pecking it; the flesh of a deer seized by (the hunter's) dog (Manu V.130 and commentaries; Vis.Sm.XXIII.49; cf. Vas. XXVIII.8). Vis.Sm.XXIII.50 expands upon the last point, ex- plaining that the meat of an animal killed by dogs, or by any other carnivorous animals (glossed as 'tigers, jackals, birds of prey, etc.'), or by such as caṇḍālas (glossed as 'outcastes and hunters'), is pure. Tryambaka's claim that women are innately pure is therefore by no means obvious. 
He supports the claim in two ways. In doing so, he wisely avoids the pitfalls of comparing women with men: the beliefs surrounding sexual difference make that a fruitless approach. Instead, he produces evidence for a purity that is, by its very nature, peculiar 
to women. 
First, he alludes to the traditional view, encapsulated in the Vedic marriage hymn (vivāhasūkta; R.V.X.85), that the marriage cere- mony celebrates not the young girl's first marriage, but her fourth. Her previous three marriages are on the transcendent or symbolic plane.22 As the vivāhasūkta explains, Soma acquired her first, then the Gandharva, Agni was her third husband, her fourth is born of 
21. nityam āsyam śuci strīņām... // Manu V. 130a; Vis.Sm.XXIII.49a (Nand. quotes Laiigabarhaspati, smṛtyantara and Yamasmṛti in support of the purity of women). Cf. Br.Sam.73.8 (the feet of brahmins, the backs of cows, the faces of goats and horses are pure; but women are pure all over); Vas.XXVIII.9. 
22. For other sets of four items of which three are invisible and transcen- dent and only the fourth is visible here on earth (e.g. purușa, R.V.X.90; vāk, R.V.I.164.45; and the sacred fires, Tait.Sam.II.6.6.1, Sat.Br.I.2.3.1), see Malamoud 1982:36.

man (manusyajāḥ).23 The three deities are the divine guardians of the young girl. According to Sāyaṇa, Soma marries the girl child at birth (jātām kanyām; Sāy. on R.V.X.85.40), for the moon is the deity of early growth, who 'moulds the years' (samānām, glossed as samvatsarāṇām; māsa äkṛtiḥ, glossed as kartā; R.V.X. 85.5 and Say.). The Gandharva is the deity of childhood and virginity (cf. R.V.X.85.21-2). Agni is the god of maturity, dwelling in the sacred fire round which the bride must walk. According to the Grhyasamgraha (quoted in the commentary on the Gobh.gr.III.4.6 statement that a bride should be nagnikā), Soma enjoys her first, the Gandharva, when her breasts develop, Agni when she menstruates. Alternatively, in the words of Samvārta 64 (cf. Sm.C.I.p.79), Soma enjoys a girl when hair begins to grow on her body, the Gandharva when she menstruates, Agni when her breasts develop. Each in turn ‘marries' the girl, enjoys her favours, rewards her, then passes her on (R.V.X.85.41a). By the time the girl reaches her fourth husband, therefore, she is the recipient of three divine gifts. As Tryambaka intones of women in general (in a quotation attributed vaguely to 'Manu, etc.'), 'Soma gave them cleanliness (saucam), the Gandharva an auspicious (or pure; subham) tongue (lit. "speech" or "voice”), Agni all-round purity (sarvamedhyatvam); and there- fore women are pure (medhya) indeed.'24 The commentators on Yājñ.I.71 stress that this does not mean that women are without fault (Mit.); nor that their sins are less serious than those of a man (Bal.); it merely explains why the penalties incurred by women are lighter (Mit., Bal.). But it is a powerful sloka, often called to the defence of women: by Raghavānanda to enlarge upon Manu's dictum that a woman's mouth is always pure (Manu V.130); by Viśvarupa to show that, unlike men, women, being pure in body, speech and mind, are free from sin;25 by Apararka in praise of women (Dh.kosa l.ii.1086). In Sm.C.I.p.79, however, the sloka is 
-23. somaḥ prathamo vivide gandharvo vivida uttaraḥ/ tṛtiyo agnis te patis turīyas te manusyajah // R.V.X.85.40. Cf. Par.gr.1.4.16-17.

declared to be ‘only in praise of women' (praśamsāmātram), meaning that the allusions to ritual purity (sarvayajñārhatvam) are purely rhetorical (cf. Br.Sam.73.7 for a similar verse). 
This important sloka is often adduced as evidence for another quite different issue, that of the early marriage of girls (see my discussion of nagnikā in section IIA, pp.86–8; cf. Thieme 1971). As the symbolism stands, however, it seems obvious that a girl was expected to marry her human bridegroom after receiving the signs and gifts of the three gods; that is, after her breasts had developed and she had begun to menstruate. But the obvious is repeatedly ignored. According to the Jyotirnibandha, for example, two years should be allowed for each deity, and therefore a girl should not marry until she is six years old (Vidyāmṇava 1974). Similarly, Samvārta 67 concludes that a girl should be safely married off before she develops any of the three signs of femaleness already described as indications of her divine marriages (see Samvārta 64, cited above); preferably at the age of eight.26 ilthough such interpretations are clearly distortions of the text, it is evident that something very like them is accepted by Tryambaka. For if he acknowledged the real import of the Ṛgvedic verse he quotes (and thus the need for girls to marry after menstruation), then he would not feel the need to defend ṛtukāladharma with such vigour (see section IV, pp.287-8). For a detailed analysis of R.V.X.85 in its Rgvedic context, including a useful discussion of these three celestial 'husbands' or 'guardians' of the bride, see Menski 1984:II, 23.1, pp. 219-83. 
Tryambaka's second argument for the purity of women tackles the important question of menstruation. Far from being the mark of great sin, menstruation, according to his next quotation (also attributed to 'Manu, etc.'), is the mark of an all-encompassing purity unique to women. 'Women are incomparably pure; at no time are they defiled; for menstruation sweeps away their sins month after month.'27 In fact, this is the classic argument not for the

The Inherent Nature of Women 
255 
purity of women per se but for the proper treatment of women who have become 'defiled' by contact with other men (e.g. Baudhāyana- vivaranam, Dh.kosa I.ii.1085). Vas.XXVIII.2-3 includes in this category women who have been raped or carried off by thieves, as well as those who are merely bad-tempered or who have left home. In a sloka recalling the story of Indra's brahminicide, Manu V.108 asserts that menstruation purifies women of impure thoughts (glossed by Medh. as 'thinking about other men').28 Early dharma- śāstra writers took a similar view of a wife's adultery, ruling that she should be abandoned only if she continued to go astray (cf. Par. Sm.X.34), or if she conceived (cf. Yajñ.1.72; garbhena dusyate kanyā, Mbh.XIII.36.17). Some writers, like Aparårka, insist that such lenient passages refer only to 'mental' rather than physical adultery (etac ca mănase vyabhicāre; Apar. on Yājñ. I.72). This point of view makes progeny not sexual fidelity its main concern. 'Physical' adultery is doubly reprehensible for it may both deprive a man of the son he needs for religious observances and lead to confusion of class (varṇasamkara; Manu VIII.353). 
Notwithstanding his insistence here on the innate purity of women, Tryambaka belongs to the sterner school of thought. Although he does not deal specifically with adultery, he has in- cluded many of the familiar slokas on the subject in his section on ṛtukāladharma (section IV, pp.287-8). (Chief among these is the pronouncement that the wife who 'offends against' (langhayet) her husband should be devoured by dogs in a public place (Sdhp.38r. 2-3 ‹ Manu VIII.371). Similarly, in his section on dying with one's husband (sahagamanavidhi), Tryambaka embarks on a lengthy discussion of whether or not sahagamana may be regarded as a prāyaścitta or rite of atonement for women who have behaved badly (even in a non-sexual sense). He concludes that there is no such prayaścitta for women; that there is therefore no escaping the penalties awaiting such a woman in hell; and thus that women would be well-advised to behave (see section IV, pp.295-7). In view of these two quite separate judgements, it is hard to see what power of purity other than the symbolic might be conferred by the menstrual flow of women. Tryambaka's concern, however, is not to present a coherent view of how women fit into the cosmic scheme

of things, but to persuade women to conform. Hence his problem: he must show on the one hand that women are in dire need of reli- gious instruction, and on the other that they have not fallen too low to appreciate and apply it. 
Having established a woman's peculiar claim to purity, Tryam- baka must also demonstrate that she is inherently and uniquely blessed (see note 19). Such a view is clearly not in line with orthodox beliefs about karma and sexual difference. If birth as a woman is the result of bad karma, and birth as a (twice-born) man that of good karma, in what sense can one argue that the former is more fortunate than the latter? It would be like saying that being born a sūdra, although strictly speaking the penalty for bad karma in a previous life, is in fact a greater blessing than birth as a dvija. This seems especially unlikely with regard to brahmins who by the mere fact of their birth are to be honoured by the gods (Manu XI.84); who own everything by virtue of their innate superiority (Manu I.100); who are gods visible here on earth, maintaining both the universe and the gods in heaven (Vis.Sm.XIX.20-2); who are the highest beings in the whole world (Mbh.XII.56.22); and so on. 
But this is precisely what Tryambaka claims. He draws his evidence from a passage in the sixth book of the Visnupurāna. Since the quotation he gives is both incomplete and out of context, it will be useful to present a fuller version of the story here. Book V of the Visnupurāna ends with the destruction of the Yadavas. Book VI describes the dissolution of the universe and the onset of the kali age in which 'four-footed virtue' is destroyed (dharmaś catuspäd, VI.1.8; cf. also Kurm.P.I.27.20; Manu 1.81–2 and Kull.; vrṣo hi bhagavān dharmaḥ, Manu VIII.16). Chapter 1 describes the de- generation of all things in the kali age: the rules of varna and āśrama are no longer observed (Vis.P.VI.1.10); people take what texts they choose as scripture, worship whatever gods they please (Viş.P.1.14), decide for themselves what is right (Viș.P.VI.1.15); men of all levels consider themselves equal to brahmins (Viș.P.VI.1. 23); women are fickle, short, greedy, disobedient, selfish, immoral, and so on and so forth (lolupā hrasvadehāś ca bahvannādanatat- parāḥ...; Vis.P.VI.1.28-31). According to another description of the kali age, women will have too many children (bahuprajaḥ), be short of stature (hrasvadehāh), cast off all morals (sīlācāravivarjitāḥ), have intercourse through the mouth (mukhebhagāḥ), bristle with hair (keśaśūlāḥ), and fornicate with slaves and even animals (Mbh. III.186.35-6, 55; cf. Kurm.P.I.28.140). Perhaps as an antidote to 
The Inherent Nature of Women 
257 
this, chapter 2 of the Visnupurana recounts in the form of a story the few redeeming properties of this degenerate age (cf. Br.P.229. 15-36; PVK V.ii.928–30; Wilhelm 1982:1–17). 
The story runs as follows. Some sages were unable to agree in which of the four ages the least merit accrued the greatest reward, and by whom that reward was most easily obtained. They went to Veda-Vyasa, found him in the midst of his ablutions, and waited. Three times, Vyāsa immersed himself. As he rose the first time, he pronounced the kali age excellent;29 as he rose the second time, he congratulated the sudra on being blessed;30 and as he rose the third time, he exclaimed that no one was more blessed than women. But once again, it is a back-handed compliment that praises someone or something in the company of other people or things not normally praised. His bathing ritual over, the sages asked him to explain these apparently extraordinary pronouncements. Vyasa's answer is characteristic of the puranic ideal. The kali age is the best in that it is the easiest age in which to achieve religious merit: what in the kṛta age takes ten years of tapas, brahmacarya and japa may be achieved in the kali age in one day and night; the results obtained by meditation in the kṛta age, by sacrifice in the treta age, by worship in the dvāpara age, may be attained in the kali age merely by reciting the name of Visņu (Vis.P.VI.2.15-17). The sudra is blessed be- cause none of the restrictions on the dvija (i.e. years of study and self- denial, costly sacrifices, strict rules governing food, etc.), apply to him; he has only to serve the twice-born to obtain his reward (Viş.P.VI.2.22-3). The case for women is much the same. 
Tryambaka quotes only the parts of this story that refer to women. The somewhat mutilated passage reads as follows. "The great sage immersed himself, rose up once more and said: "Women are supremely blessed (sādhudhanya[h]). Who is more blessed than them?" '31 Tryambaka explains that 'when they heard Vyasa's words, the sages asked him what he meant and Vyasa replied....'32 The quotation continues with the relevant parts of Vyasa's answer. 'Since, O twice-born men, a woman who is of benefit to her hus-

band by serving him in thought, word and deed, will come to dwell in the same heaven as he does33 — that is, (she can attain) those same (worlds) as a man (can but) without enormous effort- that is why I said the third time about women that they are blessed.'34 Vyăsa concludes the episode: 'Dharma is fulfilled in the kali age with very little effort35 (... and) by women without effort merely by serving their husbands. And that is why, the third time, I considered these (three; i.e. the kali age, the sudra and women) to be most blessed (dhanyataram).’36 
Tryambaka's purpose here is clear. He wishes to demonstrate first, that women are not beyond religious instruction; secondly, that they are to be envied for the ease and efficacy of the religious duty allotted to them. But if we examine this evidence in its purāņic context, there is a serious contradiction here. For the purānas introduced several striking changes into the religious ideals and practices of the post-Vedic era. The notion that the highest re- wards can be attained by the least effort is typical. But if, as Vyasa declares, repeating the name of Visnu has replaced the tapas, brahmacarya and so on of the dvija, why has it not also replaced the dvijaśuśrūṣaṇam of the sudra and the patiśuśruṣaṇam of women? Bhakti, if it is allowed at all, supersedes the obligations of both svadharma and sanātanadharma. By bhakti, Harikesa sidesteps the svadharma of the yakṣa (cf. Matsy.P.180.5ff.; Sk.P.IV.32.I–175); Sukesin that of the rākṣasa. Vām.P.11-16 describes how the latter, a king of demons (11.7), sought advice from holy sages regarding the duties specific to each class of beings (11.14-27). He is told of the

dharma prescribed for daityas (11.16) and rākṣasas (11.26). After a discourse on the actions leading to hell (remarkably similar to the dharma of demons, 12.1-43), the sages list the 'ten-limbed' sanātana- dharma prescribed for all (14.1). Sukesin returns to his city of demons and commands them all to practise sanatanadharma (16.1–4) and bhakti (16.19). Angered by the demons' deviation from their ordained svadharma (16.34-7), Sūrya destroys their city (16.38–9). Sukesin is saved by the intervention of Śiva, who thus effectively upholds bhakti against svadharma. But despite his purăṇic quotations, Tryambaka is not of the puranic mould. His rigid codification of strīdharma places him firmly in the orthodox post-Vedic age. He uses Vyasa's pronouncements solely to prove that women are not beyond redemption; the implications of the comments on the kali age simply do not apply. 
For Tryambaka, patiśuśruṣaṇam is not only the most effective religious observance for women; it is the only one. His section on things to be avoided makes this abundantly clear. Not only may a woman not worship any god other than her husband, but she is also forbidden to engage in any religious observance other than devotion to him. Here Tryambaka declares only that women are blessed with the easiest path to heaven; there he intones that any alternative or additional observance will 'cause them to fall' (see section IV, pp.274-6, note 7). Such pronouncements dismiss the claims of bhakti altogether: women must conform to the functions prescribed. For the moment, however, the emphasis is on the unique blessing that a female birth confers. In view of this, Tryambaka concludes that 'it is indeed reasonable (to suppose) that there is an interest (on the part of women) both in receiving instruction in their religious duties and in performing them.'37 
Tryambaka's insistence on the blessings of being born a woman recalls the story of king Bhangāśvana, whose success and happiness so irritates Indra that the god transforms him into a woman (Mbh. III.12). Leaving his family and his kingdom, the female Bhangāśvana retires to the forest where she produces another family with an ascetic living there. Indra causes the two sets of children to quarrel

and kill each other. The carnage complete, he gives Bharigāśvana the opportunity of reviving one set of children, Bhangāśvana chooses the children she has produced as a woman on the grounds that the love of a woman is greater than that of a man (Mbh.XIII. 12.42). When Indra then offers to transform her back into a man, Bhargāśvana refuses. She prefers to remain in her female form because she has found that women always experience greater pleasure in sexual intercourse than men (Mbh.XIII.12.47),38 This is an interesting story in the context of strīdharma for it makes a virtue of the much-maligned sexuality of women. For example, the usual assertions are that the sexual drive is stronger and more destructive in women (e.g. Mbh.XIII.20.59–60, 64–7); that sex, the cause of death in the world, is the direct result of the passionate nature of women (e.g. Mārk.P.49.28-9); that the origin of evil itself is directly linked to the sexual passion of women (e.g. Mbh.XIII.40. 5-12). Even Tryambaka's argument that women are uniquely blessed does not extend to a defence of female sexuality. For, as we have seen, he does not take issue with Manu's statement that women are innately promiscuous and oversexed (see note 9). For Tryam- baka's purposes at this point, the story of Bhangāśvana would be counterproductive. 
Tryambaka's third and final argument in support of his thesis that women can benefit from religious instruction is simply that even bad people can improve. He takes as his scriptural proof the famous (but here unattributed) saying that 'good conduct destroys inauspicious mark(s)'.39 The complete sloka, taken from Manu's section on rules for the snataka, maintains that good conduct makes all things possible-long life, the desired offspring, inexhaustible wealth - thereby annihilating the inauspicious potential (alakṣ- anam) of one's nature or circumstance.40 Sarvajñanārāyaṇa and Rāmacandra gloss alakṣaṇam as alakṣmīm (‘misfortune'); Rāgha- vānanda as ninditarogaparadārādisevanam ('culpable diseases and a fondness for the wives of other men', i.e. both physical and be- havioural defects; cf. Manu XI.48-54). Such defects cause those

who have them to be despised by good people (Manu XI.53); if they are not expiated in this life, one is reborn with 'culpable characteristics' (ninditair lakṣaṇair; Manu XI.54). However, ac- cording to Manu, good conduct produces good effects even if one lacks all auspicious marks (sarvalakṣaṇahino 'pi; Manu IV.158), even-to return to the context of stridharma-if one has the mis- fortune to be born a woman. Tryambaka's version of all this runs as follows. 'Because of the saying that "good conduct destroys in- auspicious mark(s)", it is indeed possible (for women) by virtue of their good conduct (i.e. as a result of religious instruction) to give up the (inherent) faults (traditionally and rightly) ascribed to them.'41 
This is the orthodox view of svadharma. In the story of the worm that makes its way back up the scale of births (kīṭopäkhyānam; Mbh. XIII.118-20), the moral is that good conduct produces auspicious births, evil conduct evil births. And good conduct is defined as that appropriate to one's birth (Mbh.XIII.120.9). Thus a kṣatriya who performs his duty well (vṛttaślāghī, i.e. who is praised for conduct appropriate to his station; Mbh.XIII.119.23) becomes a brahmin. For women, who cannot purify themselves by mantras or worship other gods, strīdharma is the only hope. If they fulfil the require- ments prescribed, they may be rewarded by being reborn as men, perhaps even as dvija men blessed with the right to recite mantras. Granted this means of purification, they may then aspire to better and better births. In the meantime, however, strīdharma must be their only goal. 
Tryambaka's contribution to the debate on strīsvabhāva is not to be found in any one point, but rather in his juxtaposition of negative and positive statements about women in an attempt to make sense of the inherent contradictions. The more usual approach is to keep the negative and positive quite separate, and not to admit of a con- tradiction at all. Hence we find eulogies of exemplary individuals or the ideal roles of wife and mother in one place, and denunciations of wicked individuals or the wickedness of women in general some- where else. 
Manu, for example, tells us that one's daughter is the highest object of one's affection (Manu IV.185, among the rules for snā- takas); that one's sister and aunts deserve the same respect as one's 
41. nirūpitadoṣāṇām tu ācāro hanty alakṣaṇam iti vacanāt sadācāreṇa nivrttih sambhavati // iti // Sdhp. 2r.7-8. Cf. note 37.

mother (Manu II.133, among the rules for students); that one owes one's mother-in-law the respect due to the guru's wife (Manu II.131; cf. Manu IV.183); that one's mother is a thousand times more venerable than one's father, a hundred thousand times more so than an ācārya (Manu II.145; cf. Manu II.227). Elsewhere, however, he warns that even a learned man should take care when in the com- pany of a woman, even his own mother, sister or daughter, for it is the nature of women to seduce men (Manu II.213-15; cf. Manu IX.14-17). As Tryambaka's examples show, the Rāmāyaṇa is dotted with derogatory references to women and yet exorbitant praise of such as Sītā (see notes 11-18). In the Mahābhārata, Draupadi is praised for her management of husbands and house- hold (Mbh.III.222-4; cf. section IV, pp.280-1); and celebrated as the 'salvation of the sons of Pāndu' after she has rescued her husbands from the consequences of the ill-fated dice-game (Mbh. II.64.2). Kunti is honoured as the ideal long-suffering mother (e.g. Mbh.I.138.15-19), Gāndhārī as the embodiment of intelligence and justice (e.g. Mbh.II.66.28ff.), Sulabhā for her wisdom (Mbh. XIII.308), and so on. Yet when the nature of women comes under discussion-as, for example, in the strīsvabhāvakathanam re- counted to Yudhisthira by Bhisma (Mbh.XIII.38)—then women are the root of all evils, nothing is more wicked than women.42 Occasionally, positive and negative are juxtaposed with somewhat startling effect, as when a nāga's wife, already described as obedient, dutiful and virtuous, is asked if she has neglected her duties ‘due to being weakened by the imperfect understanding natural to women' (akṛtārthena strībuddhyā mārdavīkṛta; Mbh.XII.347.2-4). But even then, the implicit contradiction is neither stressed nor ex- plained. 
At the heart of this confusion is a barely examined but radical distinction between the wicked nature of women (strīsvabhāva) and the virtuous behaviour of wives (strīdharma). This distinction is never explicitly made in any rulings on strī, not even in a text like the Strīdharmapaddhati. But the stress on wifely occupations and duties, and the total lack of interest in the woman except as wife (e.g. in her childhood, her education, the occupations open to her before marriage, etc.) clearly imply that all notions of 'woman' 
42. striyo hi mülam doṣānām // Mbh.XIII.38.1b,12b. na strībhyah kimcid anyad vai pāpīyastaram asti vai // Mbh.XIII.38.12a. Cf. notes 4,6,7.

263 
should be submerged in the ideal of 'wife'. This is true even when the husband is away (see section IV, p.291), or has died (see section IV, pp.291-8, 298-304). Thus any part of 'woman' that diverges from the ideal 'wife' is due to her wicked nature and to be con- demned. This makes sense of such examples as that of the nāga who praises his dutiful wife yet condemns her woman's nature. It also explains why the two topics are usually treated separately; why the strisvabhāvakathanam is a tirade of abuse (Mbh.XIII.38) while the discourses on the duties of women present models of patience and virtue (e.g. Mbh.XIII.124, 134). If the two can be opposed, conflict and argument are clearly possible. But can they logically be opposed? 
In its widest, cosmic sense, dharma is the law of the universe, the fundamental order sustaining the world, inherent in the very nature of things. Both descriptive and prescriptive, it indicates both what is and what ought to be, the real and the ideal. In the realm of individual action, therefore, it embraces both what one does and what one ought to do. The kṣatriya, for example, should and does fight; the vaisya should and does engage in business. Each individual's action, defined by birth and circumstance, is his duty; it was ordained to be so and is therefore right. At this level, there is no conflict: individual dharma is simply the reflection of cosmic law. But two areas of conflict emerge in relation to the dharma of women: the potential clash between stridharma and sanātanadharma (see section V, pp.309-12); and a confusion within the notion of svadharma itself. In the case of men, svadharma is usually taken to mean the specific duties laid down by vara and asrama. According to Medhātithi and Kullūka (on Manu II.25), svadharma is of five kinds: that of varna; that of āśrama; that of varna and āśrama combined; that arising from a particular cause or occasion (nai- mittikadharma; such as that appropriate for the purification of something, dravyaśuddhyādi, Medh.; or the rules of expiation, prāyaścittavidhi, Kull.); and that inherent in having a particular quality or characteristic (gunadharma). According to Kullūka, gunadharma is that which accrues because of a quality; for example, the quality of being a king (i.e. one responsible for his subjects) gives rise to the protection of those subjects.43 But there is surely no 
43. yo gunena pravarteta gunadharmaḥ sa ucyate/yatha mürdhabhişik tasya prajānām paripālanam // Kull. on Manu II.25. 
 
264 
Strīdharmapaddhati 
conflict here. For the inherent nature of an individual, his svabhāva, is the source of his dharma, not a temptation away from it. Thus the šūdra, even if freed by his master, is not released from servitude because this is innate in him44 and was ordained (cf. Manu VIII. 413). The sudra's servile nature impels him to serve; the king's regal nature impels him to rule, fight and protect. As the Bhagavadgītā declares, a man must act according to his ‘nature' (prakṛti), how- ever wise he is.45 His svabhāva is thus both his character and his duty, both what is and what is right. 
So why is this not true of women? Why is it consistently assumed that a woman's svabhava will entice her away from her duty instead of reinforcing or defining it? In what sense can the svabhava of women alone be in opposition to their svadharma, and therefore bad? 
Perhaps the treatment of kings is the nearest parallel to that of women. Manu exhorts the king to control his senses at all times (Manu VII.44), in particular to beware of the ten evil tendencies that arise from the love of pleasure (kāma) and the eight that arise from anger (krodha). The former (kāma) covers hunting (mrgayā), gambling (akṣa), sleeping in the day (divāsvapna), censure (parivāda), women (striyah), drunkenness (mada), the three kinds of music (tauryatrika; i.e. song, dance and instrumental music), and frivolous or fruitless travel (vṛthātyā; Manu VII.45,47). The denunciation of women here is in fact a warning against excessive sexual indulgence and, perhaps, the snares of domestic life. This is a typical example of how women are treated: not as individuals, but as symbols of all that is considered bad about sex and the family. The latter (krodha) covers scandal-mongering (paisunya), violence (sāhasa), treachery (droha), envy (īrṣyā), slander (asūyā), seizure of property (artha- dūṣaṇa), and verbal and physical assault (vāk-, dandapārusya; Manu VII.48). Out of these, Manu isolates the seven worst-drunkenness, gambling, women and hunting (due to kāma); physical and verbal assault, and the unlawful seizure of property (due to krodha) – and describes them as 'prevalent everywhere'.46 Thus, in the Mahā-

bhārata, Vikarṇa seems to be excusing Yudhisthira when he says that gambling is one of the four vices (vyasanāni) of kings (Mbh.II. 61.20). Similarly, Carstairs describes how, in his village in Rajas- than, the Rajputs hold riotous parties at which daru is drunk 'till they become senseless' and summonses are sent to the 'drummer- girls'. Such behaviour, clearly a lapse of self-restraint, is seen as intrinsic to the svabhāva of their class: as one Rajput confesses, 'That is what Rajputs are like... uneducated, uncivilised, lusty men' (Carstairs 1971:109–10). 
But the parallel with women is not exact. For Manu is merely stating the dangers inherent in the powers of kingship, and thus the pitfalls to be avoided by the conscientious king. Despite the many scriptural examples of such kingly behaviour (parakṛti, see note 53), neither Manu nor Kautilya ever state that kings are ‘by nature' drunkards, gamblers, lechers, abusers of people and property, and so on. In Kaut.I.6.1-12, a sixfold classification of evil tendencies (lit. ariṣaḍvarga; ‘enemies') that a king should cast out is illustrated by twelve examples (two of each), drawn largely from the Maha- bhārata and the purāṇas. In each case, the king and his kingdom perish; in none of them is any generalization made about the in- herent nature of kings. The problems awaiting the king are those inherent in his function; hence the warnings. Those awaiting women are inherent in their nature; hence the condemnation. However, the line between the dangers inherent in a function and the inherent characteristics of one who holds that function is far from clear, even in the case of kings. 
The problem occurs when one's nature somehow fails to coincide with one's function. Normally, there is no problem. Certainly, dharmaśāstra does not admit of one. But if we look beyond the codification of dharmasastra to the vaguer realms of puranic mythology, the problem is there. For example, a cruel and devious nature is appropriate in the demon whose function is to obstruct the gods. As O'Flaherty explains, this is at first a purely structural opposition between the gods and the demons. Gods and demons are 'separate but equal': each does his own job; the gods encourage sacrifice, the demons destroy it. Later literature develops the moral emphasis: it is still true that the demons are only doing their job, but they are evil nonetheless (O'Flaherty 1976:64-5). Similarly, promiscuity is acceptable in the apsaras whose function is to seduce both men and gods. Thus Menaka, who is described as 'distinguish- ed in the divine qualities of the apsaras' (gunair divyair apsarasām... 
 
266 
Strīdharmapaddhati 
visisyase), is sent by Indra to seduce Viśvāmitra away from his ascetic activities (Mbh.I.65.20ff.). When Viśvāmitra, falling for her charms, lusts after her, the apsaras is 'blamelessly willing' (sa căpy aicchad anindită; Mbh.I.66.7). For nature is appropriate to func- tion; and both, being the result of karma, are ordained. Hence the whole of creation—including yakṣa, rākṣasa, apsaras and asura—is ordained to be as it is, each according to his or her karma (yathā- karma; Manu 1.37,41). 
But what if the demon wants to be good; for example, the demon king Bali who rules virtuously in hell (Vām.P.49.1-14); or Prahlada, the pious demon who respects brahmins (Mbh.XII.124.19–63)? Both must be stopped. What if the apsaras aspires to the role of wife; for example, Urvaŝi who becomes for a while the wife of Purūravas (R.V.X.95)? Such is the anomalous position of women. A demonic and promiscuous nature is ascribed as their lot due to the karma that produces a female birth (e.g. notes 6,9); yet they must suppress it all in favour of their function as wives. But whereas the (ordinary) demon or apsaras is faced with an ethical conflict ordained evil (i.e. svadharma, including svabhāva) versus aspiration to goodness (sanātanadharma)—women are caught in a trap caused entirely by karma. Their position is more akin to that of the half- breed demon priest (cf. O'Flaherty 1976:137ff.). For both Viśvarūpa (see Mbh.XII.329.17-30; Bhāg.P.VI.7.2-40, etc.) and Vṛtra (see Sk.P.VI.269.16-60), a demonic svabhāva (their maternal heritage) is in direct opposition to the svadharma of brahmin priest (their paternal heritage). Quite apart from the fact that such unions are in accordance with the principles of anuloma marriage (cf.PVK.II. 1.52), it is no surprise-in view of the orthodox attitude towards women to find that in each case the demon priest is born of a demon mother and a brahmin father: inheriting demonic qualities from one's mother fits. This pattern is reinforced by the widespread notion that a child's heart is born of its mother (see section IV, pp. 289-90). Conflict is inevitable; both Viśvarupa and Vrtra are doomed. No wonder that Śrī, goddess of fortune and model for the Hindu wife (see section IIA, pp.60-3) remarks that no one knows if she is demonic or divine, and she is called 'intolerable' (duhsahā; Mbh.XII.218.7-8). Theoretically, at least, her position is indeed in- tolerable. Hence the need for Tryambaka to address himself to the problem. 
But how might such a problem be resolved? It seems that there is 
The Inherent Nature of Women 
267 
a basic binary division of opinion: those who dispute that women are wicked, whether on rationalistic or apologetic grounds; and those who, while allowing exceptions at the level of individual or class, insist that they are. 
47 
Of the two ways of disputing the thesis that women are wicked, perhaps the least popular is the rationalistic approach. This is pursued, for example, by Varahamihira in his classical work on omens, the Brhatsamhita, written in the sixth century A.D. In his section in praise of women (strīpraśamsā), Varāhamihira rejects the traditional view of the inherent sinfulness of women on the grounds that it is not true. First, he argues that the three religious goals of man- dharma, artha and kāma-all depend on women. For women provide men with sons; they are the incarnation of Laksmi, goddess of prosperity, in the home (cf. section II A, pp.59-64); and they are the source of sexual pleasure.48 Next, he condemns those men who, having chosen the ascetic (vairāgya) path for themselves, seek to persuade others to follow them by denigrating women and ignoring their good qualities.49 Finally, he asks what faults normally attributed to women are not committed—and more brazenly - by men (Br.Sam.74.6). For example, marital fidelity is the duty of both husband and wife, infidelity equally sinful in either case; since women are faithful more often than their husbands are, it follows that women are superior (Br.Sam.74.12). Verse 14 adds that men are faithful out of impotence (aśaktyā50), women by their strength of will (dhairyena). Similarly, a man utters endearments to his wife in private but forgets her when she dies; but when the man dies, his wife is so filled with gratitude for their life together that she em- braces his corpse upon the fire (Br.Sam.74.16). Varāhamihira con-

cludes that the abuse heaped on women is the measure not of the wickedness of women but of the audacity of wicked men (dhärṣtyam asādhūnām). They are like thieves who, in the very act of stealing (muṣṇatām iva caurāṇām), jabber 'Stop thief!' to put the blame elsewhere.51 
Yudhisthira displays an equally rational attitude when he asks Bhisma to explain what is meant by the joint practice of religious duties (sahadharma) by husband and wife after marriage (Mbh.XIII. 19.1). Sahadharma is said to lead to heaven but, as Yudhisthira points out, husband and wife usually die at different times (Mbh. XIII.19.3b-4). Furthermore, the heaven or hell one goes to depends on the actions of each separate individual (Mbh.XIII.19.5). Even more to the point, both the rsis and the Veda declare women to be wicked (anṛtāḥ), so how can there be joint practice of dharma when the man is good and his wife is bad (Mbh.XIII.19.6-7)? Un- fortunately, this eminently reasonable question does not elicit the answer it deserves. Bhisma embarks instead on the lengthy story of Astāvakra and the venerable female ascetic52 to whom he is sent in preparation for his marriage. Despite her advanced age, the ascetic repeatedly attempts to seduce him, assuring him all the while that for women there is no greater delight and no more destruc- tive urge than sex (Mbh.XIII.20.59-60, 64-7); that even very old women are consumed by sexual passion (Mbh.XIII.22.4-5); that (a woman's) sexual desire can never be overcome in all the three worlds (Mbh.XIII.22.9). At last, duly enlightened as to the true nature of women—including the evident fact that even after ini- tiation and the taking of ascetic vows, even in extreme old age, a woman cannot overcome her lustful nature — Astāvakra returns to marry his bride. Like Yudhisthira, we have forgotten the question. The rational approach is once more engulfed by prejudice. 
The apologetic approach is taken by the exponents of mīmāmsā. The original concern of this school was the detailed investigation of dharma, primarily as enjoined in Vedic texts but extended to include dharmaśăstra too (see section I, p.41). For example, Jai.

1.3.1-2 rules that aśabda (i.e. smrti) is authoritative in so far as it is based on śruti; Śabara that smrti is both authoritative (pramānam smṛtih; Śab. on Jai.I.3.2) and equal to the Veda (vedatulyā hi smṛtiḥ, Sab.on Jai.VI.2.2; cf. Kum.Ta.1.3, adhi. 1-3). This in turn rests on the premise, first outlined in the Jaiminiyasūtra (approximately second century B.C.), that the Veda is eternal, self-existent and authoritative. Vedic utterances all of which are held to be eter- nally valid - are divided into three kinds. The initial division is twofold: mantra and brāhmaṇa (Jai.II.1.32-3; Kum.Ta.II.1, adhi. 11). The latter (i.e. real meaning) subdivides into vidhi and artha- vāda. Elsewhere, the Veda is divided into five parts: vidhi, arthavāda, mantra, nämadheya and pratiṣedha (e.g. Arthas.p.3; cf. PVK V.ii. 1098, 1225). Mantras are technically valid but without any real meaning: the three samhitas (Rg-, Yajur- and Samaveda) are thus bracketed out as they do not need to be understood (cf. Kum.Ta.I.2, adhi.4). Ritual utterances consist of injunctions (vidhi) that must be taken literally (karmakāṇḍa); they refer to matters beyond our experience and so may not be questioned. Non-ritual utterances (glossed as arthavada, exaggerated descriptions or explanations) must be understood in a non-literal sense (jñānakāṇḍa); they relate to matters within our experience and are therefore open to verifi- cation. If an arthavāda statement is contradicted by experience, then-in theory-preference should be given to the latter. How- ever, since by definition the Veda contains no false statements, the contradiction itself is deemed an illusion: when the correct inter- pretation is found, it will cease to appear. The classic example is the statement that 'the sacrificial post is the sun' (adityo yupaḥ, Śab. on Jai.I.4.12.23; Mīmāmsākosa II.p.909). The identity of post and sun is evidently false: it is therefore to be interpreted as a rhetorical device to glorify the post with a view to encouraging the appropriate sacrifice. 
The interpretation laid on the repeated abuse of women is merely one more example of the kind of special pleading to which the exponents of mīmāmsā are driven by their need to find all Vedic utterances true. Arthavāda is further divided into four subgroups: praise (stuti), intended to flatter the recipient into correct behaviour; condemnation (nindā), intended to frighten him/her into abandon- ing evil behaviour; the actions of others (parakrti), to point moral lessons; and the customs of a previous age (purakalpa), acceptable 
 
270 
Stridharmapaddhati 
then but not now,53 The rhetoric of praise is well known, especially in the case of brahmins. For example, a brahmin's words are never untrue (Vis.Sm.19.22); whether he is learned or not, a brahmin is a great deity (Manu IX.315); whatever defects exist in a vrata, in tapas, or in sacrificial ritual, they all disappear when brahmins support them (Par.Sm. VI.52); and so on. 
The mīmāmsā attitude to nindā is summed up by Sabara's maxim: condemnation (nindā) is not intended simply to condemn what is condemnable but to enjoin and praise its opposite.54 According to this view, therefore, Manu is not claiming that women are pro- miscuous, uncaring, vain and lazy (e.g. notes 9-10)—for all such statements may be falsified by experience—but that they should endeavour to be faithful, loving, modest and hard-working. It is, in effect, a rhetorical device for social control. 
This is an attractive interpretation. Certainly, Manu himself declares that only one who investigates the pronouncements of the ṛṣis (ārṣa) and the teachings on dharma by means of reasoning that is consistent with the system of the Veda (glossed by the commentators as the rules of mīmāmsā) can be said to understand dharma.55 But, pace R.M.Das (e.g. 1962:12; where he claims that the nindā ruling makes it unnecessary to invoke different levels or periods of teaching to explain contradictory slokas), the mīmāmsā ruling on nindā does not automatically dissolve the problem. For, if nindă were a routine method of exhortation, then women would not be singled out to receive it. Snātakas, for example, would not merely be told to avoid acquiring wealth through forbidden occupations (Manu IV. 15) or to avoid attachment to sensual pleasures (Manu IV.16); they would — as a purely rhetorical device-be condemned for having 'a natural tendency' to put wealth before duty, or for being un-

For some examples of parakṛti, see Manu X.105-8; Medh. on Manu II.151 and X.105-8. Arthavāda may also be given a threefold classification: guṇavāda, anuvāda, and bhūtārthavāda or vidyamānavāda (Medh. on Manu II.227; Śab. on Jai.I.4.23; Arthas.p.26).

duly attached to the senses 'by nature'. The various rulings on brahmins, ksatriyas and vaisyas, or even students, hermits and ascetics, would include digressions on the ‘natural dispositions' of the types involved, exhorting them to appropriate action by means of condemnation. But this is not the case. Even sudras receive in- structions or threats rather than direct condemnation. For example, they are told that they may not accumulate wealth (Manu X.129), that they may not hear, learn, recite or teach the Veda (Manu III.156, IV.99, X.127; Gaut.XII.4–6); but they are not actually described as being 'by nature' acquisitive or ambitious beyond their station. Only women are repeatedly instructed by means of direct condem- nation. So selective an application of nindā suggests that it is in practice far more than a rhetorical device: it rests on prejudice. 
Of the two main approaches supporting the thesis that women are wicked, the response of social psychology to prejudice can hardly be avoided. According to this kind of attitude, the 'good Jew' is merely the exception to an otherwise rigid antisemitism; the intelligent black merely the exception to an otherwise acknowledged racial inferiority. Neither individual constitutes a refutation of the pre- judice concerning his class: the exception to it is marvelled at instead. In the realm of women, this is perhaps the majority view. All the examples that Tryambaka quotes from the Rāmāyaṇa fall into this category. Kausalya complains that, unlike the faithful and devoted Sītā, most women are inconstant (notes 11,12). Agastya heaps abuse on women in general before exonerating Sītā from blame (notes 13-15). He also compliments Sītā by comparing her behaviour to the wicked ways of other women (note 16). In the Mahābhārata, Bhisma expounds this view. When Yudhisthira questions him concerning sahadharma, Bhīṣma reverts to prejudice, declaring (in the words of the female ascetic) that women are ob- sessed with sex: only one in a thousand, or perhaps even one in hundreds of thousands, will be devoted to her husband, a pativrată (Mbh.XIII.20.65). It is this same prejudice that persuades the common man today that 'the exception proves the rule' in the in- correct sense that it 'establishes' that rule instead of 'testing' or refuting it. 
A dramatic example of this viewpoint is found in Yasaścandra's play entitled Mudritakumudacandraprakaraṇa. The play is set in the court of Siddharāja Jayasimha, the great Călukya king of northern Gujarat (A.D. 1094-1143). Act V presents a debate between the 
272 
Stridharmapaddhati 
leaders of the two rival sects of Jainism: Kumudacandra is the head of the Digambaras, Devasuri that of the Svetambaras, while Siddharāja takes the chair. The issue under discussion is whether or not women can attain salvation. According to the Digambaras, they cannot; according to the Svetambaras, they can. The latter view maintains that, while salvation is beyond the capacities of most women, it is within the reach of those few possessed of sattva (the quality of purity or goodness). Devasuri cites as evidence women from mythology (such as Sītā) and from the contemporary world (such as Mayanalla, the queen-mother, who ruled as regent for many years while Siddharaja was a boy). The discussion reveals the two opposing poles of prejudice: the reverence shown to a few individual idealized women (whether real or mythical), and the contempt shown to women in general (Mudritakumudacandraprakarana V; cf. Sandesara 1953:362–3). 
The second approach in support of the thesis that women are wicked also allows exceptions, but on the level of a class or type of woman rather than an individual. This view takes up the radical if theoretically illogical-distinction between a woman's nature (strīsvabhāva) and her ordained function as wife (strīdharma), and pits one against the other. All fear and condemnation is directed at women as biological creatures, representatives of wild or untamed nature. Hence the pollution taboos surrounding the physical aspects of being female: menstruation, sexuality, childbirth. Hence the con- demnation of female emotion and passion. All praise is directed at women as social entities, paragons of virtue in whom the biological is tamed and controlled. This tension between 'culture' and 'nature', between 'society' and 'the wild', is a familiar one to social anthro- pologists (e.g. E. Ardener 1975; Okely 1975). For any class, race or even nation outside the self-imposed barriers of a given group may be classified as 'the wild'; women, gypsies or the Japanese. Both fascinating and terrifying, women as women are condemned. But if they allow themselves to be controlled by their ordained function as wives, the condemnation reserved for women no longer applies. 
This is evidently Tryambaka's own advice. If, by the appropriate behaviour, women transform themselves into devoted wives, then the inherent evil of their female natures- the 'inauspicious marks' (alakṣanam) of a female birth—will be annulled (note 41). Tryam- baka's treatise describes precisely how this miracle may be wrought. 
 
IV. The Duties Common to (all) Women (strīṇām sādhāraṇā dharmāḥ; Sdhp.22r.8-48v.6) 
I shall present the remainder of Tryambaka's lengthy treatise in the form of a summary. This fourth section is divided into nine major topics, following Tryambaka's own rather loose subdivisions. 
General rulings on behaviour (Sdhp.22r.9-25r.10) 
Many of the quotations in this section have been quoted verbatim in earlier ones. For example, a woman should not expose her navel, ankles or breasts (Sdhp.22r.10-23v.1 
= 
Sdhp.7r.5-6, section IIA, p.90, note 69). She should wear haridrā, collyrium, kun- kuma, sindūra, a short-sleeved bodice and so on (Sdhp.22v.5-7= Sdhp.7r.9-7v.1; section IIA, p.96, note 73). Without being told to do so, she should make ready all the items for worship (Sdhp.23r. 7-9 = Sdhp.12v.6-8, 4r.3-4; section IIC, p.179, note 35). She should eat her husband's left-overs, saying 'This is a great prasāda!' (Sdhp.23r.9-10 = Sdhp.18r.6-7; section IIC, p.222, note 108). She should never be alone, nor bathe naked (Sdhp.23v.7 = Sdhp.6v.8; section IIA, p.84, note 63); and so on. 
Others reinforce rulings already given and are discussed in the relevant sections. For example, she should never answer back even when scolded, nor show her anger or resentment even when beaten (Sdhp.23r.4-5; see section IID, pp.242-3). She should not go to festivals or public gatherings, on pilgrimages, or to such things as weddings or public shows (Sdhp.23v.2; see section IIB, p.137, note 38). If she wants to bathe in a sacred place, she should drink the water used to bathe her husband's feet, for her own husband is superior to even Śankara or Visnu (Sdhp.23v.10-24r.1; see section IIB, p. 137, note 39). The good wife never loves another man whether he bribes her with fine things, begs her humbly, or seizes her by force; if he looks at her, she does not meet his eyes; if he smiles at her, she does not smile back; if he speaks to her, she does not answer (Sdhp.24.1-5; see section IIC, p.175); and so on. 
In addition, we may note the following rulings that are representa- tive of this section. According to a quotation attributed to Āśvala- 
 
274 
Strīdharmapaddhati 
yana, the qualities of the ideal wife include 'devoted service to her parents-in-law and, especially, to her husband; co-operation with her husband in religious matters (dharmakarye 'nukulatvam); restraint in economic matters (arthakarye 'pi samyamam); bold confidence in sexual matters (prāgalhhyam kamakāryeṣu; cf. section IID, pp.237-8); cleanliness of body, an auspicious presence, and a gentle tongue'.1 With regard to her husband, according to a quotation from the Rāmāyaṇa, ‘even if he is wicked, licentious or poverty-stricken, he is-for inherently noble women- the supreme deity (paramam daivatam),"2 and her guru.3 'When she sees him returning home from outside, therefore', according to a quotation attributed to the [Smṛti-]samgraha, ‘she should lovingly hurry to bring him water, food, betel, and a fan to cool him; then she should do such things as massage his feet and speak in an engaging or amorous way (cățuvacanaiḥ) so as to drive away his cares.'4 The section ends with a well-known subhāṣita (attributed here to the [Smrti-]samgraha). 'A father gives within limits, a brother and son as well; but a husband's giving is unlimited-what wife will not worship him?'5 
Things to be avoided (varjanīyāḥ; Sdhp.25r.10-25v.6) 
This is in fact an artificial subdivision. For although the quotations do indeed spell out the activities a good wife should avoid, the

The Duties Common to all Women 
275 
section remains in effect a continuation of the earlier one on general behaviour. Three slokas in particular are worth recounting here, all of them unattributed by Tryambaka. 
'These are the six things that corrupt women (nārīṇām dūṣaṇāni sat): drinking; keeping bad company; deserting one's husband (glossed by Tryambaka as "sleeping in the house of someone other than one's husband"); roaming around (on one's own); sleeping (glossed by Tryambaka as “sleeping in the daytime"); and staying (i.e. spending time) in other people's homes.'6 Some of the aspects involved in 'keeping bad company'—that is, the men and women with whom the good Hindu wife may not properly associate-are discussed in section IIC, pp.170-6). Since it is deemed necessary to begin each day by meditating with one's husband (see section IIA, pp.52-4), it makes sense that the conscientious wife never spends the night away from him. The question of whether or not she may sleep in the hottest part of the day after the midday meal is discussed briefly on page 49. 
'These are the six things that cause women and sūdras to fall (strīśūdrapatanāni șat): recitation (or repetition, i.e. of sacred texts; japa [h]); austerities (tapas); going on pilgrimages; renuncia- tion (pravrajyā); the chanting of mantras (mantrasādhanam); and the worship of deities (devatärādhanam).”7 To this sloka we may add a similar one taken from section V, and attributed there to Aśva- lāyana. ‘Śūdras are enjoined by Brahmā to serve the twice-born always, and likewise women to serve their own husbands. Women who are devoted to their husbands should never engage in japa recitation, austerities (tapas), offerings into fire (homa), religious donations (dāna), or any other religious observance (or vow; vrata) or ritual (makha), as long as their husbands are alive.'8 The im- portant implications of these slokas have been discussed in the

Going on pilgrimages (tīrthayatra) is discussed in section IIB (pp. 132-41); renunciation (pravrajya) in the section on parapurusa (pp. 170-6); the worship of deities (devatārādhanam) in the sections on devatādhyānam (pp.52-4), the goddess Śrī (pp.60-3), devapujā (pp.178-80), vaiśvadeva (180-3) and the goddess Jyesṭhā (pp.227- 9). Offerings into the fire (homa) are described in section IIB (pp. 102- 7, homa; and pp. 107-15, the role of the wife); religious donations (dāna) in the sections on managing the household accounts (pp.168– 70) and strīdhanam (IV, pp.277-80); religious vows or observances (vrata) in the sections on the role of the wife (IIB, pp.107–15) and strīsvabhāva (III, pp.246–72). The exclusion of women from Vedic education and ritual sacrifice in general is discussed in sections I (pp.34-9) and IIB (pp. 107-15). The assertion that, for women, household duties are the equivalent of performing the sacrifice is considered in the sections on daily duties (strīṇām āhnikam, pp.44– 50) and household tasks (IIC, pp.168–76); and the idea that serving one's husband is the equivalent of the Vedic student serving his guru in the section on paying obeisance to the husband (IIC, pp.162– 3). The question of what religious practices are open to a woman after her husband has died is discussed in the sections on sahaga- manavidhi (IV, pp.291-8) and vidhavādharmaḥ (IV, pp.298–304). 
Lastly, 'nothing should be done independently (svātantryena) by a woman, either as a child, a young girl or an old woman, even in her (own) home."9 For, as Manu himself explains in the crucial following verses (omitted here by Tryambaka), she should be sub- ject to her father in childhood, to her husband in her married life, and to her sons in widowhood (Manu V.148; see section IV, pp.299– 300). The rest of this brief section is predictable. 
Women's property (strīdhanam; Sdhp.25v.6-27r.4)

riate sections. Most important, perhaps, is the notion that the pos- session of property is a necessary prerequisite for the performance of sacrifice; and thus that the ineligibility of women to own anything (since they themselves are 'owned; see note 10) means that they have no right to perform sacrifice (see section I). In addition to this, the question of whether or not a wife may earn money is raised in section IIB (pp.132-41); the wife's responsibility to manage the household accounts in section IIC (pp.168-70); her right to make religious donations (dāna) in sections IIC (pp.168–70) and IV (pp.274-6). But such passages merely touch on what is an extremely complex topic pursued in great detail in numerous commen- taries and digests. The problem here is how one may reconcile ap- parently conflicting rulings. Briefly, Tryambaka proceeds as fol- lows. 
On the one hand, there are a number of rulings that deny women the rights of ownership, inheritance and the independent disposal of property. According to an unattributed quotation (in fact taken from Manu), for example, 'these three-a wife, a son and a slave -are held to be without property ([a]dhanaḥ): whatever they ac- quire (or earn) is the property of him to whom they belong.'10 According to śruti, women are powerless (nirindriyā) and without inheritance (adāyādiḥ; Sdhp.25v.7-8). According to another quota- tion from Manu (attributed here to Kātyāyana), ‘women should not set aside anything (for their own use) from the property of the joint family or even from their own property (svakäd api ca vittād) without the permission of their husbands.'11 Regarding a woman's lack of independence in such matters (tatra svātantryābhāve), Tryambaka quotes Hārīta. 'A woman is not entitled to indepen- dence (na strī svātantryam arhati) with regard to giving (dāne) or throwing (dhamane; lit. ‘blowing' things) away, or with regard to any particular religious matter, or with regard to taking (ādāne; i.e. 
(Manu); Sm.C.III.ii.p.584 (Manu); Subh.366/15 (kimcid kāryam for kāryam kimcid).

something for her own use) or disposing (visarge; i.e. of things in general).'12 
On the other hand, according to another quotation attributed to Manu, there are six kinds of 'women's property'. 'That which is given (to her) in the vicinity of the fire (at the marriage ceremony); that which is (given to her) when (she is) taken to her new husband's home; that which (is given to her by her husband) in the act of love; and that which (is given to her) by her mother, brother and father these are known as the sixfold property of women (sadvidham strī- dhanam).'13 (For the application of the term strīdhanam to property acquired by the husband from the wife's family at the time of mar- riage, i.e. dowry, see Derrett 1984:185.) Tryambaka also points out that, according to Apastamba, 'If the wife makes an occasional religious donation (naimittike dāne) when her husband is away, this is not called "theft".'14 Similarly, the epics frequently show women (such as Kausalya) who are described elsewhere as virtuous and yet who make donations apparently in their own right. 
Tryambaka's conclusion follows Raghavananda's comment on Manu VIII.416 (quoted above, see note 10). The so-called 'inde- pendence' of the wife, like that of the slave, is no independence at all. For the wife's right to her property implies the ownership of her husband too ((bhāryādhane bhartur api svāmitvävagamāt; Sdhp.26 [1]v.2-3). What then is the difference between a wife's 'own property' and that which is common to both wife and husband? With regard to the distribution of property owned jointly by the two of them, the wife needs her husband's permission but he does not need hers. With regard to the sixfold strīdhana, however, the right of ownership is all hers; but she still needs her husband's permission to exercise it.

For his part, he may use her property only if he has her permission. Indeed, as Tryambaka explains, ‘a husband should never seize (control of) his wife's property as long as she is alive; if he does so by force (balāt), he should be punished by the king.'15 The quotation that follows-attributed to Madhava-extends the ruling to a woman's other male relatives. 'Neither husband, son, father nor brother has the power to take or dispose of a woman's property (strīdhana); if any one of them makes use of (lit. “enjoys") a woman's property without her permission (lit. "by force"), he should be made to give it back with interest (savṛddhikam) and he should incur punishment (dandam; e.g. a fine).'16,17

17. This important ruling was quoted in a recent judgement of the Indian Supreme Court hailed by the media as 'an unequivocal victory' for women's rights and a major break-through in dowry disputes'. Sunil Sethi's article, published in India Today in April 1985, opens with the following. ‘For some time now the Supreme Court has acquired a healthy reputation for passing judgements heavily weighted in favour of women's rights. Last fortnight that reputation was amply reinforced when the court passed a landmark judge- ment declaring that all gifts made over to a woman at the time of her marriage remained her absolute private property till the end; and that her husband, or any other, had no right to them without her sanction.... But the Supreme Court, in fact, was upholding the right of a woman to retain nuptial gifts as enshrined in the ancient concept of stridhan (woman's wealth) first mooted by the Vedic sage Manu. Quoting from classical treatises on Hindu law, the 25-page judgement... noted that "neither the husband, nor the son, nor the father, nor the brother, has power to use or to aliene the legal property of a woman. And if any of them shall consume such property against her own consent he shall be compelled to pay its value with interest to her...". ... In other words, gifts of cash, ornaments, silver, clothing or anything that constitutes dowry-may be entrusted by the wife to the husband to keep but he would be deemed "guilty of criminal breach of trust" if he either misappropriates or refuses to return what the court regards “as the absolute and personal property of his wife". (Sethi 1985:57.)

Strīdharmapaddhati 
Tryambaka explains that when the epics describe virtuous women such as Kausalya or Sītā giving things away, the permission of their husbands is assumed. For without the husband's permission (bhartur ājñām vina), the wife should not give anything away, even to her own relatives (naiva svabandhubhyo diśed dhanam; Sdhp.27r. 2-3). 
In praise of the pativratā (Sdhp.27r.4–33v.8) 
This section consists almost entirely of quotations, including lengthy passages quoted verbatim from the Mahabharata and the Agnipurāna. Many of the individual rulings are also given earlier in the relevant contexts. In this section, apart from the theme of the proper behaviour of wives, there is virtually no thread of argument. 
The first series of ŝlokas are attributed to ‘other smrti texts' (Sdhp.27r.5-27v.4; smṛtyantaram), the second to the Agnipurāṇa (Sdhp.27v.4-10). Both merely reinforce points that Tryambaka has made elsewhere. 
The third series consists of two entire chapters quoted verbatim from Draupadi's conversation with Satyabhama in the Vana- parvan of the Mahābhārata (Sdhp.27v.10-31v.7< Mbh.III.222–3). Satyabhāmā asks Draupadi how she has managed to gain such con- trol over her husbands (the five Pandavas) that they are never angry with her. 18 What is her secret? Is it the result of 'a religious obser- vance (or vow; vrata); (the practice of) austerities (tapas); bathing (in sacred waters; snānam); (reciting) a mantra (or spell); (using) herbs (with magical properties); the (magic) power of knowledge (vidyāvīryam); the (magic) power attained by (using special) roots (mūlavīryam); japa recitation; offerings into the fire (homa); or the (tantric rituals described in) āgama texts (āgamā[h])'?19 Draupadī rejects all such methods as appropriate only to wicked women (cf. pp.274-6 above); for drinking the water used to bathe one's hus- band's feet as the proper alternative to bathing in a sacred place, see section IIB, pp.134-8. 'My husbands have come under my

control,' she explains, 'as a result of my attentiveness, my eternal readiness to serve, and my devoted services to my elders.'20 Drau- padi then proceeds to enumerate all the familiar qualities of the pativrată. They may be summed up in one sloka. 'There is no deity like him- that is, like one's husband-in all the god-filled worlds; when he is pleased, through his grace (prasādāt) all desires are ful- filled; when angered, he kills.'21 
The fourth set of rulings, attributed to the Agnipurāṇa, is taken from Krsna's advice to his younger sister, Subhadra, on the eve of her marriage (Sdhp.31v.7-32r.2). His main point is that she should 'forget all about us (i.e. her own family), even her mother and father. For the husband alone is a woman's family; the husband alone is a woman's wealth; the husband alone is a woman's religious duty, and her chief austerity.'22 The importance of forgetting one's own family and never returning to one's father's house is taken up again at some length later in this section (p.288) 
The fifth passage is taken, with some omissions, from the con- versation between Umã and Mahesvara in the Anusāsanaparvan of the Mahābhārata (Sdhp.32r.2-33r.2 Mbh.XIII.134.32-3,34b- 
5, 36b, 38–41, 43, 45–52a, 53-5). It opens with Uma's statement that 'the religious duty of a woman (strīdharmah) is created at the outset, that is, at the time of marriage, by her relatives: in the presence of the (marriage) fire, she becomes her husband's partner in the religious sphere (sahadharmacarī).'23 Umā then enumerates the qualities of the ideal wife who 'participates in the religious duty of her husband' (dharmacāriṇī, dharmabhāginī), who 'takes his vow

as her own' (pativrată, pativratabhāginī; see pp.50, 107-15 etc.). Above all, 'the good woman always regards her husband as a god.... For the husband is god for women; the husband is family; the husband is the goal. There is no goal, no deity like the husband.'24 Umă also touches on what is a new theme for Tryambaka. ‘If for some reason a husband tells (his wife to do) something that is (normally) not to be done (akāryam), something that is against dharma (adharmam), or something that causes death (prāna- nāśanam), then—even if he is poor or sick or in trouble or in the midst of enemies, even if he is suffering from a brahmin's curse (e.g. Pāṇḍu; see section V, pp.309–10)—she should do it without hesitation, bearing in mind the (special) duties (enjoined) for difficult times (āpaddharman).'25 Tryambaka returns to this im- portant issue in his conclusion. 
The final extended quotation is taken, with few omissions, from Bhisma's conversation with Yudhisthira on the behaviour of good women in the Anusasanaparvan of the Mahābhārata (Sdhp. 33r.2-33v.8 < Mbh.XIII.12.1-3a, 6b-21; see also section III, pp. 247-8, 268). Bhisma in turn recalls another conversation: that between Sumană and Sandilī, the renowned pativrată, when the two women meet in heaven (devaloka). Asked what meritorious behaviour has brought her there, Sandili stresses that ‘it was not by wearing the ochre robe (kaṣāya; i.e. of the renunciate), the bark garments (valkala; i.e. of the hermit), the shaven head (mundā; i.e. of certain types of religious mendicants, or the widow), or the matted locks (jațilā; i.e. of the ascetic) that [she] became a deity (i.e. entitled to be in devaloka).'26 She simply followed the dictates of her reli- gious duty to her husband (patidharma; Sdhp.33v.7 Mbh.XIII. 124.21). Tryambaka's repeated insistence that the good wife should

have nothing to do with female renouncers, mendicants or ascetics is discussed in more detail in section IIC (pp. 170-6). The question of whether or not the widow should shave her head is dealt with below (pp.303-4). 
The religious duties of the menstruating woman (rajasvalā- dharmah; Sdhp. 33v.8-40r.3) 
This is a somewhat loosely structured section that touches on most of the points normally made concerning the menstruating woman. She herself is referred to in a variety of ways that reflect the range of implications usually associated with her condition. For example, she is described as 'full of impurity' (rajasvalā); 'one whose clothes are stained' (malavadvāsas); ‘overflowing with menstrual blood' (ārtavābhiplutā); 'bearing flowers' or 'in bloom' (puspini, puspa- vati); 'one who has the duty or condition of women' (strīdharminî); and so on. 
The first and most important point that Tryambaka makes is that 'the menstruating woman is impure for three (days and) nights.”27 In a later passage, he produces a famous quotation, attributed to the [Smṛti-]samgraha. 'On the first day, she is declared to be (as polluting as) an untouchable; on the second, (as polluting as) a brahmin-killer; on the third, (as polluting as) a washerwoman; on the fourth day, she is purified.'28 The significance of this impurity, and the traditional tracing of its origins to the story of Indra's brahminicide, are discussed in section III. For the symbolic 'men- strual pollution' of rivers and the earth, see Salomon 1984:157-8, 173-5. 
In this section, Tryambaka uses a quotation attributed to the Smṛticandrikā to explain that the menstruating woman loses two kinds of blood, one far more polluting than the other. "That which occurs to women at the wrong time (i.e. outside the crucial three days described above) men call "blood' (raktam); that which occurs at the

Strīdharmapaddhati 
right time (i.e. within those three days) is called "menstrual blood” (rajas); as a result of the latter alone, she becomes impure. For women (who continue to bleed from the fourth) until the twelfth day, the purification (appropriate) for urine is required; a ritual bath is (prescribed for those who bleed from the twelfth) until the eighteenth day; after that, she is (again) impure for three days (i.e. it is assumed that another cycle has begun). '29 Another quotation, at- tributed to Angiras, provides a more detailed definition. 'The best of wise men know that the menstruation (rajas) of women is of four kinds: that which is due to illness (rogajam); that which is due to (a disturbance of) the emotions (rāgajam); that which is due to (an imbalance of) the humours (dhātujam); and that which occurs at the right time (of the monthly cycle; i.e. during the crucial three days). '30 Both Angiras and Tryambaka conclude that only the fourth type of bleeding makes a woman ritually impure (aśuddha; Sdhp.35v.5). One can only speculate on the reasons behind this careful categori- zation of the polluting powers of menstrual fluid: the importance of establishing a pregnancy certainly (see below, pp.287-8); a desire to take the initiative out of the hands of woman perhaps; or merely an obsession with classification. 
Secondly, there are innumerable prohibitions relating to the menstruating woman (Sdhp.33v.9-34r.4). For example, she should not use collyrium for her eyes (cf. section IIA, pp.96-101), comb her hair (cf. section IIA, pp.96-7), massage her body with oil or ointments (cf. sections IIA, pp.96-7, and IID, pp.236-45, or take a bath (cf. section IIA, pp.82-8). She should not clean her teeth (cf. section IIA, pp.78-82), ot cut her nails. She should not ‘touch fire' (nāgnim spṛśet, i.e. cook; cf. sections IIA, pp.100–1, and IIC, pp.198-205). She should eat only those foods which are fit for sacrifice (havisyam; cf. Dh.kośa III.ii.1180, 1216, 1265, 1270-3, 1287-8 etc.; PVK II.i. p.681) and she should use either her own cupped hands (añjalinā vā pibet; i.e. like a renouncer, cf. pāṇi- pātrin, kārapātrin, Yatidh.32.85; Olivelle 1977:37, 164-8) or a

copper or iron vessel (or, according to some authorities, an un- baked earthenware vessel or one made of leaves; see section IIC, pp.217-21). She should certainly not eat food from her husband's plate (patipătre 'nnam; cf. ucchista, section IIC, pp.221-7). She should not even look at her husband (pasyed api patim na ca). She should not sleep on a high bed (cf. section IID, pp.239-40). She should not spin thread, plait or cut rope, or dig in the earth. She should not cry, laugh, talk a great deal, hear loud noises, run, roam about, exert herself, sleep in the daytime, sit in a draught; and so on and so forth. 
These prohibitions are frequently coupled with the defects accruing to her child if she disobeys. In most instances, the link between action and defect is clear. For example, if she uses collyrium, her child will be blind in one or both eyes; if she combs her hair, he will be bald. If she massages her body with oil, he will have a skin disease (duścarmā); if she takes a bath, he will die by drowning (apsu mārukaḥ). If she cleans her teeth, his teeth will be discoloured; if she cuts her nails, his nails will be diseased. Similarly, if she plaits rope, her child will hang himself (udbandhanamṛtah). If she laughs, his palate, teeth, lips and tongue will be discoloured. If she talks a great deal, he will be a chatterbox (pralāpī); if she hears a loud noise, he will be deaf. If she runs, he will be unstable (cañcalaḥ); if she roams about, he will be insane (unmattah). If she sleeps in the day- time, he will be sleepy by nature. 
However, some of the links are less obvious. For example, if she drinks out of an earthenware vessel (kharva, śarāva), her child will be a dwarf (kharva, vāmana; a pun). If she eats food from her husband's plate, her child will be insane (unmādī). If she spins (krnatti), or cuts rope, he will be impotent (klībaḥ; or perhaps of indeterminate sex); a possible allusion to spinning or cutting the 'thread' of progeny that a man is duty bound to continue (kulatantu; samtanārtham, Manu IX.96; etc.). If she digs in the earth, he will be bald or his life will be short. If she sits in a draught, he will be insane (unmattaḥ). Most important of all, if a menstruating woman makes love during the crucial three days, her child will be an untouchable (candalaḥ) or cursed (abhiśastaḥ; i.e. condemned for committing a mahāpātaka). Hence the detailed prohibitions to en- sure that the menstruating woman is neither available nor attractive to her husband at this time (cf. section IIA, pp.88-96 and 96-101). 
Thirdly, there are a number of special rulings to deal with different 
 
286

kinds of coincidences. For example, while there is a prohibition on bathing in general (snānamātraniṣedhe 'pi) during menstruation, the ritual bath prescribed for a specific occasion (naimittikam snānam; see section IIA, pp.82-3) must still be performed, but in some other way. (The menstruating woman should somehow sprinkle her body with water without getting her clothes wet; Sdhp.35r.4-7.) Similarly, what additional rite of expiation (prayas- citta) should be performed by a menstruating woman who is further polluted by contact with an untouchable (caṇḍāla, śvapāka), an inferior sūdra (antya, antyaja; i.e. the lower-caste or untouch- able śūdra), an outcaste (patita, i.e. one guilty of a mahāpātaka), a dog or a crow (the candālas of the animal and bird kingdoms) (The answer depends both on which day the contact occurred and on whether she was eating at the time; Sdhp.36v.2-7.) What should a woman do if she begins to menstruate when she is already in a state of impurity due to a birth or a death in the family? (She should have water poured on her head by a brahmin; Sdhp.36v.7–9.) What should she do if, while menstruating herself, she touches or is touched by another menstruating woman? (The answer depends on the varṇa of the two women involved, who is responsible for making contact, and whether that contact was intentional or prolonged; Sdhp.36v.9-37r.10.) 
Fourthly, there are the rulings for the ritual bath of purification on the fourth day (Sdhp.36r.1-36v.1, 37r.10-37v.7). Towards the end of the morning (samgave; see p.45) on the fourth day, she should cleanse herself with sixty lumps of earth; if she is a widow, with twice that number (cf. section IIA, pp.71-4). Then she should clean her teeth (cf. section IIA, pp.78-82), and take a ritual bath with her clothes on (sacelam; cf. section IIA, pp.82-8). Pure once more, she should gaze at the sun (bhāskaram dṛṣṭvā), pray for a son (putram prarthya), and attend to her woman's duties (strī dharmam ... samācaret). According to a quotation attributed to Atri, 'when she has bathed properly, she should look at her husband's face and no one else's, or (if he is away) she should look at the sun while meditating on her husband in her mind."31 That evening, she should make sexual advances to her husband (upasarpati; Sdhp.40r.1). A quotation attributed to the Agni-

purāna is more explict. ‘Anointed with unguents of ground turmeric (haridra) and saffron (kunkuma; cf. section IIA, pp.96-101), wearing bright garments, thinking of her husband's "lotus foot" (patipādābjam; i.e. with the reverence due to one's guru or god; cf. sections IIC, pp.156–68, 221–7, and IID,pp.236–45), gazing at her own toes (i.e. keeping her eyes down), not looking at other men, thinking only of her husband, thinking of him as light itself (bhargam eva), always (keeping herself) pure (i.e. by taking care not to touch anything polluting), beautifully dressed and ornamented (bhūṣitā) and anointed with perfume (cf. section IIA, pp.88–101), and in good spirits (sumanāḥ), she should go to bed (see section IID, pp.236–45).'32 If bleeding continues after the fourth day, she is considered 'fit to be touched' (sparśayogya; Sdhp.36r.8) and there- fore pure with regard to her husband (suddha bhartu[h]; Sdhp.36г. 5); that is, she should still make love to him. Until her menstrual flow has ceased altogether, however, she is not held to be 'of pure conduct' (sādhvācārā; Sdhp.36r.6) and therefore she is not 'fit to perform the ritual worship of the gods and so on' (daivādikarma- yogy[ā]; Sdhp.36r.7-8). 
Finally, there are the rulings concerning the importance of making love at the proper time (ṛtukāladharma) and the penalties or atone- ments (prāyaścitta) enjoined for both husband and wife if they fail to take advantage of this opportunity to conceive (Sdhp.37v. 7-38r.5, 39v.10-40r.3; cf. nagnikā, section IIA, pp.86-8). The penal- ties described are in fact those normally advocated for adultery. Apastamba provides an example. ‘A man who fails in his duty to his wife should put on the skin of a donkey with the hair turned out- wards and go to seven houses calling (out to each in turn): “(Give) alms to a man who has failed in his duty to his wife!." And this should be his livelihood for six months.'33 A variety of penalties may be imposed on the wife who refuses to make love; and again these are penalties mainly associated with adultery (cf. section III).

According to Āpastamba, she should perform the severe twelve-day kṛcchra penance (see Manu XI.211; Vas.23.43; PVK IV.p.132,145) for six months (Sdhp.37v.9–10 < Āp.I.10.28.20). According to the Brahmandapurāna, she should be abandoned (parityājyā; Sdhp. 38r.3-4). According to Manu, 'the king should have her devoured by dogs in a (public) place where many people have gathered (to watch).'34 In her next life, according to an unattributed quotation, she will be reborn as a bitch, a she-wolf, a female jackal or a female hog (Sdhp.39v.10-40r.1; for the retention of gender in transmig- ration, see sections IIC, p.226, and III, pp.246-7). According to Baudhāyana, her husband should proclaim her publicly to be a foetus-killer (bhrūnaghnīm; cf. section IIC, pp.217-21) and drive her out of his house (Sdhp.38r.4-5 < Baudh.IV.1.22; Dh.kosa I.ii. 1019). 
Tryambaka interprets this last ruling to mean that she should be sent back to her father. He then devotes considerable space to proving that the good wife never returns to her father's house (Sdhp.38r.5-39v.10). His evidence includes lengthy quotations taken from the Rgvedic marriage hymn (R.V.X.85 and comm- entary), the Yajurveda (and commentary), the Drāhyāyaṇaśrauta- sūtra (and commentary), and the Sakuntala story from both the Mahābhārata and Kālidāsa. The conclusion is clear. 'People suspect a married woman who spends time with her own relations and, even if she is chaste, (they assume) otherwise; that is why (even) her own relatives insist that she remain near her husband, even if he does not like her. '35 As Kanva explains to Sakuntala, 'even slavery (dāsyam api) in your husband's house is right (kṣamam)' (Sdhp.39v.8 
Abhijñānasakuntalam V.27). 
The religious duties of the pregnant woman (garbhiṇīdharmāḥ; Sdhp.40r.3-42r.1)

The Duties Common to all Women 
289 
relating to the proper behaviour of the pregnant woman. Many of them are given elsewhere in the more general context of the good wife. For example, even if the pregnant woman-who is naturally tired at this time as a result of the weight of the unborn child (garbhabharālasāyāḥ svabhāvataḥ) — abandons all other orna- mentation, she should not abandon those things which are asso- ciated with the woman whose husband is still alive: that is, haridrā, collyrium and so on (Sdhp.41r.4-7; cf. section IIA, p.96, note 73). Similarly, she should perform the popular naktavrata that involves a morning bath, a pūjā to Pārvatī (the model of the devoted wife; see section I), and eating only at night (Sdhp.40v.2). 
Some rulings are more specific to pregnancy. For example, the pregnant woman should avoid such things as riding elephants and horses, climbing hills or onto housetops (kuñjarāśvādiśailaharmyādi- rohanam), strenuous physical exertion (vyāyāmam), walking fast (sighragamanam), riding in a cart (sakaṭārohanam), blood- letting (raktavimokṣam), and so on (Sdhp.40v.3-5). If she obeys these rules, she will have a son who lives for a long time and is very wealthy (putraḥ sthirāyur vṛddhisamyutah); if she does not, she will cause a miscarriage (garbhapatanam avapnoti; Sdhp.40v.6-7). The ruling that a pregnant woman should avoid sexual intercourse (... vyavāyam ca garbhiņī varjayet sadā; Sdhp.41r.3-4) is some- what at odds with the widespread idea that-due to the boon granted to women by Indra when they agreed to take on part of the guilt of his brahminicide (see section III, pp.250-1)—if a woman wants to make love, her husband should not refuse, right up to the delivery of her child (Yājñ.I.81, Mit.; Tait.Sam.II.5.1.4-5; etc.). 
Secondly, Tryambaka deals with the importance of indulging a pregnant woman's cravings (dohadapradānam; Sdhp.41r.9). He quotes Yajnavalkya. ‘As a (direct) result of not indulging the craving of a pregnant woman, the foetus acquires some defect (doṣam); that is, some deformity (vairūpyam) or even death. That is why what women desire (when they are pregnant) should be done. '36 Even if she wants something that is bad (ahitam) for her, she should

be given it: a little is in this case good or at least somewhat good (hitopahitam alpakam, Sdhp.41v.3< Astängahṛdayam, śarīrasthānam 1.53b; cf. Obeyesekere 1963:340-1). The reasoning behind this derived here from the medical authority, Vāgbhata—is that the heart is one of the 'soft' organs bequeathed by the mother (for the others, see Jolly 1901:81). 'For (the child's) heart is born of its mother (mātrjam) and is (thus closely) linked with its mother's heart; it is therefore not right to deny the cravings (śraddhāvimānanam) of the pregnant woman.'37 For in indulging the mother, one is in fact indulging the child. The cravings felt by the mother are thus in rea- lity those of the foetus for all that it experienced in its former life (Jolly 1901:77). Medical texts derive dohada from dvaihṛdaya, ‘two- hearted', on the grounds that the hearts of mother and foetus are linked in this way. 
Two points may be made here. First, this close relationship between the hearts of mother and child supports the idea that the half-breed demon priest inherits his mother's demonic heart (or svabhāva; see section III, p.266). Secondly, the dohada or craving of the pregnant woman is a recurrent motif in South Asian culture and folklore. More important, it can provide a graphic (but cul- turally acceptable) expression of a woman's hostility towards her husband, her ambivalence towards her child, and her resentment regarding the traditional role of women in society (cf. Bloomfield 1920; Tawney 1924:1, appendix III; Obeyesekere 1963). 
Finally, Tryambaka describes the entry of the pregnant woman into the lying-in chamber (sütikāgāra veśanam; Sdhp.41v.4-42r.1). She should be led into this special room where all that is necessary has been gathered together (sambhāraiḥ sambhṛtam; Sdhp.41v.9; cf. Jolly 1901:82-3) in or before the ninth month, or even at the moment of giving birth (prasūtisambhave kale sadyo vāpi; Sdhp. 41v.5), at a suitably auspicious time, and with a ceremony to bring good luck (kṛtakautukamangalām; Sdhp.41v.10). Moreover, she should hold in her hand a fruit that has a masculine name (hastastha-

'Bahata' is the South Indian version of 'Vägbhaṭa'.

punnāmaphalām; Sdhp.41v.10) in order to encourage the birth of a 
son. 
The religious duties of the woman whose husband is away (proṣitabhartṛkādharmāḥ; Sdhp.42r.1–3). 
This brief section quotes two well-known but here unascribed rulings, without comment. 'When her husband has gone to another country, the chaste woman (sati) should forego perfumes, garlands, collyrium, (using) the teeth-cleaning stick and (chewing) betel.'38 'The woman whose husband is away should abandon playing, adorning her body, attending gatherings and festivals, laughing, and going to other people's houses.'39 Mit. on Yājñ.I.84 glosses ‘playing' (krīdām) as ‘with a ball and so on' (kandukādibhiḥ), ‘at- tending festivals' ([u]tsavo) as 'marriages and so on' (vivāhādiḥ), and 'laughing' (häsyam) as 'with the mouth open' (vijṛmbhaṇam). Such are the self-imposed deprivations implied by Draupadi when she tells Satyabhāmā that she always observes a 'vow' (bhavāmi vratacāriņi) when her husband(s) is (are) away (Sdhp.29r.9< Mbh. III.222.29; see section IV, pp.280-1). The implications of the individual items of beautification and personal hygiene have been discussed earlier in the appropriate sections.40 
The injunction relating to dying (literally 'going') with (one's husband) (sahagamanavidhih; Sdhp.42r.3-45r.5) 
Of the nine topics discussed in this section on the duties common to all women, this is perhaps the most interesting. For in 1789,

The issue of attending festivals and public gatherings is raised in sections IIB, pp. 132-41 (e.g. note 38) and IV, pp.274-6; visiting the homes of others in section IV, p.275, (note 6). Finally, the reasons a man is permitted to leave home are given in section IIB, pp. 132-41.

'suttee' was officially noted by the government of Bengal. The campaign against the custom, led by Rammohan Roy (1772-1833), met with considerable hostility from the orthodox community (see Anantaråma's Sahānumaranaviveka).41 In 1829, Suttee Regulation XVII made the practice illegal. In 1830, eight hundred Hindu con- servatives appealed to the Privy Council on the grounds that the Act interfered with Indian culture and religion. In 1832, the pro- suttee appeal was rejected. In the Maratha court of Thanjavur in the mid-eighteenth century, however, the orthodox position was still maintained. Tryambaka presents it as follows. 
He begins with two resounding quotations that advocate the practice of sahagamana. First, 'at the time of a girl's wedding, the brahmins should recite (these words): "May you be one who ac- companies her husband (always,) when he is alive and even when he is dead!"''42 Secondly, according to Sankha, ‘if, when her husband has died, a woman ascends with (him; samarohe[t]) into the fire, she is glorified in heaven as one whose conduct is equal to that of Arun- dhati.'43 
Tryambaka next considers the objection (nanu...) that saha- gamana is in fact a form of suicide, and therefore prohibited (ätma- hatyārūpatvena niṣiddhatvāt; Sdhp.42r.6-7). Of the two quotations given to support this objection, the first is the standard pūrvapakṣa against suicide. ‘And therefore one should certainly not depart (this life) before its full length (has been lived out).'44 The second is Iś. Up.3, together with the common misinterpretation of the phrase ātmahano janaḥ to mean 'people who kill themselves' instead of 
41. I am indebted to J. Duncan M. Derrett for drawing my attention to this work.

'people who kill (i.e. are ignorant of) the (true) Self' (cf. Radha- krishnan 1974:570; Hume 1971:361, note 4; PVK II.ii.p.927, Vāj.S.40.3). Tryambaka argues that this objection is invalid be- cause the prohibition on suicide is a general rule (sāmānyavacana) and is therefore open to modification by supplementary rules giving the exceptions to it (viseṣa). Just as the general rule that ‘one should not desire to kill any living being' is modified by supple- mentary rules-for example, that in certain rituals an animal should be sacrificed-so the general prohibition on suicide is also modified by supplementary rules. These include rulings related to the religious suicide of the ascetic who kills himself at a sacred place in order to go directly to heaven (cf. Yatidh.17.1–32; Olivelle 1977:42-3, 96-8); the deliberate courting of death in battle by the heroic warrior (cf. Yatidh.17.8; Olivelle 1977:97); and—according to Tryambaka—the self-immolation of the widow on her husband's funeral pyre (Sdhp.42r.8-42v.8). 
Tryambaka's second argument in favour of the practice is that 'dying with one's husband (bhartranumaranam) is recommended for women because it brings great rewards.'45 Although not spelled out, the crucial issue here is whether the ritual act of sahagamana is naimittika (i.e. required by the particular 'occasion'; in this case, by the husband's death) or kamya (i.e. to be performed only if one desires the rewards accruing to the action; cf. nitya, naimittika and kāmya in the context of ritual baths, section IIA, p.82). If it is naimittika, the widow must join her husband on his pyre; if it is kāmya, she only needs to do so if she wants to enjoy the 'great rewards' promised by the scriptures. Tryambaka evidently admits that sahagamana is a kāmya act and therefore entirely a matter for the individual widow to decide. However, his repeated assertion that it is to be recommended (ślaghyam, prasastah), together with his daunting descriptions of the only alternative open to the widow who remains alive (see below, pp.298-304), makes his own opinion on the question abundantly clear. 
He proceeds to quote numerous slokas describing the 'great rewards' in store for the pious widow who chooses to die. I have selected some of the more memorable examples. 'The husband is to be followed always (sahānuyātavy[aḥ]): like the body by its shadow, like the moon by moonlight, like a thundercloud by

lightning.'46 "There is no doubt that the woman who follows (anuvrajanti) her husband gladly from his house to the cremation ground attains with every step the reward(s) of the horse-sacrifice.'47 'Just as the snake-catcher drags the snake from its hole by force, even so the virtuous wife (sati) snatches her husband from the demons of hell and takes him up to heaven.'48 'Yama's messen- gers recognize a virtuous wife (satīm) from afar and take to flight. Even if her husband has been an evil man, they let go of him at once, exclaiming, "When we see a devoted wife (pativratām) hurtling towards us (to rescue her husband), we messengers (of Death) are less afraid of fire and lightning than we are of her!"'49 'There are 34 crores of hairs on a person's body: she who dies with (anu- gacchati) her husband will dwell in heaven for the same length of time.'50 '(Even in the case of) a husband who has entered into hell (itself) and who-seized by the servants of Death and bound with terrible bonds—has arrived at the very place of torment (vātanästhānam); (even if he is already) standing there, helpless and

wretched, quivering (with fear) because of his evil deeds;51 even if he is a brahmin-killer or the murderer of a friend, or if he is un- grateful for some service done for him — (even then) a woman who refuses to become a widow (avidhavā nāri) can purify him: in dying, she takes him with her.'52 Tryambaka concludes that 'according to established custom as shown in the eloquent statements (given above), this (act of) dying with (one's husband; anumaraṇam) when put into practice by a devoted wife (pativrataya)-confers great blessings on both (wife and husband).'53 
Tryambaka now considers the rewards accruing to the bad wife. 'If (this act of dying with one's husband is) put into practice by a sinful woman, it brings about the destruction of that sin.'54 The quotation that follows is quite clear. 'Women who, due to their wicked minds, have previously (i.e. until then) despised their husbands, and who have always behaved disagreeably towards those husbands, who (though) being of that kind (yet) at the (ap- propriate) time perform the (ritual act of) dying with their husbands (bhartrānumaraṇam) — whether (they do this) of their own free will, or out of anger, or even out of fear-all of them are purified (of sin).'55 This is the scriptural justification for forcing women to burn themselves.

deeds of either husband or wife; the sacrifice purifies both of them. 'As a result of this (ruling),' Tryambaka concludes, 'when saha- gamana is performed by a woman who has done wrong—that is, what her husband did not like (cf. section V)-throughout her lifetime, (then) it is said to have the quality of a prayaścitta.'56 In this sense, it is the ultimate, and only effective, prāyaścitta for the bad wife. 
As Tryambaka admits, however, this conclusion conflicts with the special rulings relating to the kali age (Sdhp.43v.1-3; cf. kali- varjya, PVK III. p.926-68). One of these is that the rite of atonement that culminates in death (maraṇāntikaprāyaścitta) is prohibited in the kali age. The quotation is unambiguous. These duties (i.e. those listed in the previous unquoted passages) are to be avoided in the kali age, say learned men; as is the prescribing to brahmins of any rite of atonement (prāyaścitta) that culminates in death.'57 Tryambaka merely sidesteps the problem, remarking that whether or not the bad wife should perform sahagamana to wipe out her sins is best left to great men to decide (kartavyam na kartavyam iti mahadbhir vivecanīyam; Sdhp.43v.3). 
Tryambaka's weakness as a mīmāmsaka is evident. For there are two crucial issues here: whether or not sahagamana is really a prāyaścitta for the bad wife; and, if so, whether this particular maraṇāntikaprāyaścitta is in fact prohibited in the kali age. Tryam- baka argues neither well. Instead, he embarks on a lengthy (and poorly structured) explanation of why it is important for a wife to behave properly during her and her husband's lifetime (Sdhp.43v. 3-44v.3). If there is no maranantikaprāyaścitta for the errant wife, then she cannot escape the torments awaiting her in the next world. For-according to a variety of quotations-even if she has bathed in all the sacred places, the bad wife will go to the hell of dung and

urine (viņmütre narake), or burning oil (taptatailanarakam); she will be a widow, or a bitch, or a sow in her next life; she will be infested with worms in this one; and so on. Since statements such as these make no reference to any other prayaścitta that can wipe out the effects of a wife's bad behaviour (prāyaścittāntarābhāvāc ca sarvathā; Sdhp.44r. 10-44v.1), Tryambaka suggests that there is none (that is, he implies, none other than sahagamana). The wife's only hope is to worship and placate her husband at every turn. The inadequacy of Tryambaka's reasoning on this point becomes clear when one compares it with, for example, that in the Mitäkṣarā on Yajñ.III.226. Tryambaka's intention, however, is transparent. He is evidently suggesting that, despite the rulings regarding the kali age, sahagamana is in fact the safest course of action for the not-so- perfect wife.

Tryambaka raises one final question. 'Now the objection may be made (nanu) that this (practice of) dying with one's husband (anu- gamanam) is applicable to kṣatriya women and so on (i.e. to the lower varṇas), but prohibited to brahmin women.'58 Several quotations are produced in favour of this view. For example, ‘as a result of Brahma's instruction, following one's husband when he has died (mṛtānugamanam) is not appropriate) for brahmin women; but, for the other varnas, this is held to be the supreme duty for women. Or, 'the brahmin woman who does not die with her husband, (even though she is) distracted by grief, obtains the goal of renunciation (pravrajyā; glossed by Tryambaka as brahma- caryam; i.e. vidhavādharma, see below); (whereas) by dying, she becomes one who has committed suicide (ātmaghātinī; i.e. she incurs the sin thereof).'60 According to Tryambaka, however, such statements in fact prohibit brahmin women from ascending

a separate pyre (pṛthakcityārohaṇaparatvāt; Sdhp.45r.2-3). The implication here is that the chief or brahmin wife, the patnī, should join her husband on his pyre (anvārohana) while the junior wives of lower varna should burn on separate ones (anumaraṇa). As the quotation from Usanas explains, a brahmin woman should not go (i.e. die) by ascending (samāruhya) a separate pyre, but for other women this is the ancient duty for wives.'61 
Tryambaka's conclusion is obvious. The religious duty (or practice) of dying with one's husband is commended (prasastaḥ) for women,'62 whether brahmins or not, whether good or bad. 
The religious duties of the widow (vidhavādharmāḥ; Sdhp.45r. 5-48v.6) 
Judging by his previous section, Tryambaka believes that the best course of action open to the widow is that of dying with her husband. The way in which he opens this section reinforces that view. 
'If for some reason, by some stroke of fate (daivayogāt), she does not follow her husband (anuyāti), then her virtue (śīlam) must be protected; for if her virtue is lost, she falls down (to hell).'63 More important perhaps, her loss of virtue (silam) causes her husband to fall from heaven (svargāt patiḥ patati; i.e. into hell), and her parents and brothers too (Sdhp.45r.7-8; Aśv. in the Pārijāta). The 'stroke of fate' implies that the wife in question is pregnant, men- struating or caring for a small infant when her husband dies (see Par.M.II.i.p.58-9; Sm.M.I.p.162; Sahā.I.8,etc.; cf.PVK II.i.p.633). Of these, the menstruating woman may burn herself after her ritual bath on the fourth day (cf. pp.286-7). 
Tryambaka then describes the conduct that will ensure that the

widow's virtue is safe. For the rest of her days, she should live the subdued and restricted life of the celibate student (kṣäntä niyatā brahmacārinī; Sdhp.45r.9, Manu ‹ Manu V.158) as opposed to the life of the married woman with all its outward signs of happiness and ornamentation (cf. section IIA, pp.88-101). She should willingly mortify her body (kamam tu kṣaped deham), living on flowers, roots and fruits (Sdhp.45v.10, Manu Manu V.157); or, alternatively, on fruits, vegetables and barley (Sdhp.45v.3, Asv.). She should eat only once a day, and in addition she should perform regular severe fasts (Sdhp.45r.1-3, Āśv. ‹ Sm.M.I.p.160, etc.). She should wear undyed (vṛktam) garments, no bodice (kañcukam), no perfumes (gandhadravya) or unguents (udvartanam; Sdhp.46r. 6-8, Aśv.; cf. section IIA, pp.88-101). If she binds her hair on top of her head (kabarībandha), she causes her husband to be bound in the other world (bhartṛbandhāya jāyate, Sdhp.46r.5, Aśv.; cf. section IIA, pp.96-101). She should sleep on the ground (bhūśa- yanam kāryam), never on a 'high bed' (paryanka; Sdhp.45v.4-5, Āśv. < Sm.M.I.p.160, etc.; cf. section IID, pp.236-45). She should not even mention the name of another man (Sdhp.45v.10–11, Manu (Manu V.157), nor have any sort of contact with him (Tryambaka's gloss; Sdhp.45v.11-46r.1). 
In fact, her lifestyle is repeatedly compared with that of the ascetic or Vedic student (for similar associations in south India today, see Fuller and Logan 1985:89ff.). For example, 'the ascetic (or renouncer; yati), the celibate student (brahmacāri) and the widow should avoid (chewing) betel (cf. sections IIA, pp.96-101, and IIC, pp.229-33, anointing (their bodies with oils or unguents; cf. section IIA, pp.96-101), and eating off copper or brass vessels (cf. section IIC, pp.217-21; Yatidh.57.79-92; Olivelle 1977:37, 168).'64 In other examples, the parallel is made by specifically calling the widow's way of life (vidhavāvrata) 'renunciation' (e.g. pravrajyā; see above, note 60) or, in the widest sense, 'the celibate life' (e.g. brahmacāriṇī, Sdhp.45r.9, Manu ‹ Manu V.158; brahma- caryam, Sdhp.46r.4, Āp.; etc.). But the widow may never leave

home as a true renunciate. Tryambaka explains. 'Forsaking sons, brothers and other (male relatives) after her husband (dies), and living independently, incurs condemnation.'65 For a woman may never act independently (see above, p.276, note 9); as a widow, her dependence is simply transferred from husband to sons. Indeed, 'the woman (i.e. widow) who is (truly) devoted to her husband should not do anything without (first) asking her sons.'66 
Devotion to one's husband, even after his death, thus remains the key point of the widow's life. If she has no son (putrābhāve; Tryam- baka's gloss), she should make funeral offerings (tarpanam kāryam) to her husband daily, and to his father and grandfather (Sdhp. 45v.5-6, Āśv.). 'She may worship Visnu (but only) if she thinks (all the time) of her husband, not otherwise. She should meditate on her husband alone, always; that is, (on her husband) in the auspicious guise of (the god) Visnu. '67 'For she (i.e. the widow) who takes refuge in the religious duty of the virtuous wife (sati- dharmam) should always worship her husband, bringing him to mind by means of a portrait or a clay model. '68 
Not surprisingly, Tryambaka makes no mention of or allowance for the remarriage of widows. However, he does raise the question of niyoga, a practice much discussed in commentarial and digest writing. The point at issue is whether or not the widow of a man who dies without a son may, after her husband's death, have sexual intercourse with another man appointed' (niyukta) to produce that son for him. The problem is caused once again by a conflict of rulings. On the one hand, a widow should not even mention the name of another man (see above), let alone have intercourse with

him. On the other hand, a woman is at fault if she does not bear a 
son; 
and a man without a son is barred from heaven. Tryambaka presents the purvapakṣa argument in favour of niyoga first. A blanket prohibition on sexual intercourse with a man other than one's husband is inappropriate (anupapannam) ‘because even though blame is attached to sexual intercourse with another man for the sake of pleasure, it is necessary for the purpose of (producing) a son. '69 The evidence for this is derived from the story of Jaratkaru in the Mahābhārata. Threatened with the extinction of their line (samtanaprakṣayāt), and the dire consequence that they will all fall into hell, Jaratkaru's ancestors entreat him to produce a son (Sdhp.47[1]r.2-3; cf. Mbh.I.13.9-34). For 'there is no heaven for one who has no son.'70 
The next step in the argument in favour of niyoga is the ruling that 'in the absence of a natural (aurasa) son, it is necessary that a kṣetraja son should be acquired.'71 In this context, the 'field' (kṣetra) is the wife and the 'owner of the field' (kṣetrin) is her husband. The son 'born of his field' (kṣetraja) is the son born to a man's wife by another man on his behalf; whether the husband in question is dead or incapacitated (e.g. by impotence, disease or a curse). The sower or 'owner of the seed' (bījin) is the man 'appointed' (niyogin) for this task. For the traditional list of the kinds of sons deemed acceptable for the two crucial purposes of making śräddha offerings to the ancestors (pindadāne) and dividing the inheritance (amsagrahane), Tryambaka quotes at length from Yajnavalkya (Sdhp.47[1]r.5.5–9‹ Yājñ.II.128-32). According to this quotation, the kṣetraja comes third in order of importance; that is, after the son born to a man by his own wife (i.e. married according to the proper religious ritual; auraso dharmapatnījaḥ), and the son of a putrikā daughter (putrikäsutaḥ, Sdhp.47[1]r.5-6; for a discussion of the putrikā, see section IIB, pp.146-7). Tryambaka draws further evidence from the story of Parasurama in the Mahābhārata. When Parasurama killed all the male kṣatriyas, their widows asked brahmins to produce sons with them on behalf of their dead hus-

bands (Sdhp.47[1]r.9-13 Mbh.1.98.3b-5). Finally, Tryambaka cites the well-known examples of Kuntī, Ambikā, Ambālikā and so on, all of whom had sons by the practice of niyoga (Sdhp.47[1]r. 13-14; cf. section V, pp.309-10). 
According to Tryambaka, however, the purvapakṣa position is untenable. Only two kinds of son are acceptable in the kali age: the aurasa and the adopted son (dattaka, datta; Sdhp.47[1]r.14-47[1] v.2). This in turn raises the question of whether, if a man dies without a son, his widow may adopt on his behalf. According to Tryambaka, she may, but only if her husband gives his consent to adoption before he dies (Sdhp.47[1]v.2-5).,For, according to Baudhāyana, ‘a woman may not give or take a son except with the consent of her husband.'72 If he dies without giving his consent, she may not adopt; but neither may she resort to the practice of niyoga. Instead, she must devote herself totally to the celibate life already described (brahma- caryavrata, vidhavāvrata). Tryambaka quotes Manu. 'Many thous ands of men who have remained celibate (brahmacārīṇām) from their boyhood, and who are (therefore) without sons, have (nonethe- less) gone to heaven without (first) continuing their family line. (Similarly,) when her husband dies, the virtuous woman (sādhvī stri) who has taken up the celibate life (brahmacaryavrate) goes to heaven even if she has no son, just like those male celibates (brahma- cāriṇaḥ).'73 
In section V, however, the question of niyoga is approached from another angle altogether, and with the opposite conclusion: if a man wants his wife to practise niyoga then what is strictly speaking wrong becomes right (see section V, pp.309-10). 
Tryambaka also discusses the interesting question of the im-

The Duties Common to all Women

purity and inauspiciousness traditionally ascribed to widows. The examples he quotes are typical. 'Just as the body, bereft of life, in that moment becomes impure, so the woman bereft of her husband is always impure, even if she has bathed properly. Of all inauspicious things, the widow is the most inauspicious; there can never be any success after seeing a widow (cf. section IIA, pp.54-7). The wise man should avoid even her blessing (tadăsiṣam api)—excepting only that of his mother-for it is devoid of all auspiciousness, like the poison of a snake (āsīviṣopamām).'74 
According to Tryambaka, however, such remarks apply only to the widow who does not behave as she ought (ācārahīnāviṣayam; Sdhp.47[2]r.4-5). For even if she becomes a widow, the pativratā 'who is devoted to (good) conduct' (caryāparā), ‘fully committed to her religious duty' (dharmasamayukta), and 'who follows (the proper path of) widowhood (vaidhavyam palayet) — earns a three- fold reward: she is both happy and auspicious (subha) in this life; she obtains the pleasures of heaven (svargabhogan), or indeed the same heaven as her husband (patilokam); and she marries that same husband again in her next life (Sdhp.47[2]r.5-7). Theoretically at least, if she behaves as she should (see above), the dread inaus- piciousness with which the scriptures threaten her are cancelled out. But if she cannot do this, she would presumably be well-advised to die with her husband. 
Tryambaka finally raises the question of whether or not the widow should shave her head. In south India today, widows are in fact traditionally tonsured after the funeral (cf. Fuller and Logan 1985:95) but this is a late development calculated to bring the widow in line with other 'renouncers' (cf. Yatidh.21.39,104-5; Olivelle 1977:38,104-6). Tryambaka argues that '(rulings that prescribe) shaving the head (śiraso vapanam) apply to brahmin women; (those prescribing) keeping the hair (long apply) to women of other castes.'75 The quotation is taken from the Mahābhārata where 
74. vyāsaḥ // jīvahīno yathā dehaḥ kṣaṇād asucitam vrajet / bhartṛhīnā tathā yoṣit susnātāpy aśuciḥ sadā | amangalebhyaḥ sarvebhyo vidhavā hy atya- mangalam / vidhavādarśanāt siddhiḥ kāpi jātu na jāyate // vihāya mataram caikām sarvamangalavarjitām / tadaśisam api präjñas tyajed āśīvisopamām // iti // Sdhp.47[2]r. 1-4 (Vyāsa) < Sk.P.III.2.7.49-51 (dehi for dehaḥ; syad for hy aty"; kvapi for kāpi; sarvā mangalavarjitāḥ for sarvamangalavarjitām).

Dhṛtarastra's widowed daughters-in-law (i.e. kṣatriya women) are described as having dishevelled hair (asimantasiroruhā[h], lit. 'without a parting'; Sdhp.47[2]r.8-10 < Mbh.XV.32.15). 
In contexts other than widowhood (e.g. for certain prāyaścitta rituals when performed by unmarried girls or women whose hus- bands are alive), the phrase 'shaving the head' (siraso mundanam) is taken to mean simply cutting two fingers' breadth (angulidvayam) off the ends of the hair (Sdhp.47[2]v. 1-3; cf. Bhardwaj 1983:154). In fact, as Tryambaka explains, the four main prohibitions relating to the performance by women of certain aspects (or component elements; anga) of vratas include a prohibition on shaving the head (kesavapanam). The other three concern sleeping or staying far from home (dūre śayanāsanam); staying in the cow-pen at night, or following cows about in dangerous places during the day; and wearing deerskins (ajinam vās[ah]; Sdhp.47[2]v.6–8). 
Tryambaka concludes that three kinds of women merit the name of pativrată: the wife who dies before her husband (bhartuḥ pūrvam mṛtā) and patiently waits for him to join her; the wife who follows her husband onto the funeral pyre (bhartră sahānugatā), exempli- fied by Madri; and the wife who after her husband's death lives an ascetic and celibate life for the rest of her days (vāvajjīvam brahma- caryādinā yuktā), exemplified by Kunti. The first kind of wife is the auspicious ideal. But if the husband dies first, inauspiciousness and misfortune may be offset by either of the two options open to his widow. While the second alternative is deemed safer than the third -given the nature of women and the difficulties of leading a truly ascetic life—all three earn the ultimate reward of reaching the same heaven as their husbands (patisālokyam; Sdhp.48r.9-48v.6). 
 
V. Tryambaka's Conclusion: Obedient Service to one's Husband is the Primary Religious Duty (of a wife) 
(patiśuśrusanam mukhyo dharmaḥ; Sdhp.48v. 7-88r. 1). 
Tryambaka returns to the point at which he began. 'Obedient ser- vice to one's husband (bhartṛśuśruṣaṇam, Sdhp.1v.2; patiśuśrū- sanam, Sdhp.48v.7) is the primary religious duty enjoined by sacred tradition for women' (see section I, introductory verse 1, p.29, note 2). In this section, he defines obedient service to one's husband' in three ways. First, a wife should serve her husband 'without regard for her own life' (prāṇānām avigananaya). Secondly, she should accept whatever her husband does 'even the sale of herself" (ātma- vikraya °). Thirdly, she should obey his will 'even when it conflicts with other religious duties' (itaradharmopamardena).1 Most of the rest of the treatise is taken up with some short and some extremely long examples of these three aspects of patiśuśruṣaṇam. I shall deal briefly with the most important ones. 
As suggested in my introduction, this unwieldy section was probably intended for the ears of the young daughters-in-law of the household (cf. pp.9-10). This would explain the long quotations from well-known stories and the marked lack of any real argument. It was presumably hoped that such lengthy retellings of favourite and traditional tales would inspire impressionable young women to conform to the highest ideals of strīdharma.

(Sdhp.48v.8-49r. 1; Sdhp.48v.9-10< Ram.III.4.3b). 
In the story of the brahmin whose life is forfeit to the crane-demon, Baka, the brahmin's wife begs to be allowed to go in his place (Sdhp.49r.1-3). As she explains, 'this is the supreme and ever- lasting duty of women in this world: (the wife) should pursue what is good for her husband even (at the cost of) abandoning her life.'2 
The story of the female pigeon caught by a cruel and wicked bird- catcher is told at surprising length (Sdhp.49r.3-55r.8; Sdhp.49r. 5-55r.8< Mbh.XII.141.1-145.18, with few omissions, some vari- ants). 
It includes several slokas on the virtues of the pativrată. For example, for a man who has fallen on bad times (kṛcchragatasya), there is no friend (mitram), no medicine (bhesajam), no relation (bandhuh) and no goal (or refuge; gatiḥ) like a wife (Sdhp.51r.3-4 < Mbh.XII.142.9b-10a, variant). 
After a fierce storm in the forest, the bird-catcher puts the female pigeon in a cage, and then by chance takes refuge at the foot of the tree in which the pigeons live (śaraṇam yāmi yāny asmin daivatāni; Sdhp.50v.2-3 < Mbh.XII.141.26b). Despite her predicament, the female pigeon entreats her husband to pursue the householder's religious duty of offering hospitality to the guest (i.e. the bird- catcher who has come to their tree). The pigeon is inspired by his wife's words. He brings fire and fuel to keep the man warm and then, since he has no store of food to offer, he enters the fire himself in order to provide the guest with a meal. Impressed, the bird-catcher resolves to abandon his wicked ways, become an ascetic, and em- bark upon the great journey unto death (mahāprasthāna; i.e. a maranāntikaprāyaścitta, cf. section IV, pp.295-7). The pigeon's wife is released from her cage. At once, she declares the futility of remaining alive without her husband and throws herself into the same fire. A heavenly vehicle (vimāna) takes both her and her husband to heaven. Eventually, the bird-catcher follows their example: he deliberately enters a forest fire, dies, and ascends to heaven. 
In the Mahābhārata, the story is told to Yudhisthira by Bhisma to

demonstrate the householder's supreme duty to offer hospitality to anyone who asks for it (cf. section IIC, pp. 183–210; and, incidental- ly, to describe the heavenly rewards awaiting the devoted wife who dies on her husband's funeral pyre (cf. section IV, pp.293-5). Tryambaka uses it to illustrate the first subpoint of his conclusion: that the good wife should serve her husband without concern for her own safety. 
Accepting (even) her husband's sale of her (bhartṛkṛtātma- vikrayāngīkāraḥ; Sdhp.55r.8, sodhapatra 3 < Mārk.P.VIII. 51b-53, 55b, 57, 59–60, 63-6; with variants) 
The inserted passage is an extract from the story of Hariścandra as told in the Märkandeyapurana. When King Hariścandra in- advertently crosses a brahmin ascetic, the ascetic demands not only his kingdom and property but, over and above that, a sacrificial fee. In order to pay the latter, Hariścandra auctions his wife as a slave in the public market. An old brahmin buys her and drags her off by the hair (keseṣv athādāya nṛpapatnīm akarṣata). Instead of com- plaining, the queen begs the old man to buy her young son as well so that she can continue to take care of him. 
In the context of the Märkandeyapurāṇa, this story demonstrates that a man should put his religious duty to brahmins even above his affection for his wife and child. An extremely popular Buddhist

3. In MS T1, the story of the pigeons and the bird-catcher ends with an omission mark and the word sodhapatra in the margin (... iti // adhyāyaḥ// // Sdhp.55r.8). The text itself continues with the example of the third aspect of patiśuśrūṣaṇam (itaradharmopamardenāpi ... // Sdhp.55r.8). The sodha- patra cited is now missing but it is clear from MS T2 that it was inserted between folios 55 and 56. For the scribe of T, copies T, as it stands (... iti // adhyāyaḥ // śodhapatra // // itaradharmopamardenāpi ... //). On reaching the end of T, folio 55v, he copies the sodhapatra without a break: pādyam āca- maniyam vai dadau bhartus tadāsanam || bhartṛkṛtātmavikrayāngīkāro ... // T1 55v.10/T2 42v.11). At the end of the Hariścandra story (... sahai- kastham abandhayat | iti /), he drops back into the pigeon story in the middle of a line: syu[h] sarvadevatäḥ... // (cf. T, 54r.2). He then tells both the rest of that story and the entire Hariścandra episode (T2 44r.7-44v.5) again. The Mysore MS (M) makes no such mistake: after the pigeon story, it tells the story of Hariscandra, thus incorporating the sodhapatra of T, as intended. Following MS M and PT, I have assumed the same.

version of this idea may be found in the story of Prince Vessantara who gives away all he has, including his wife, Maddī, and their two children. We are told that Maddi accepted her treatment without resentment or question, saying that her lord and master could give her away, sell or even kill her if he chose (cf. Cone and Gombrich 1977:75, 8 570). Tryambaka's point is much the same: even in such extreme circumstances, the ideal wife thinks only of her duty to her husband and son. 
Even if it conflicts with other duties (itaradharmopamardenāpi; Sdhp.55r.8-66v.3) 
Tryambaka's main example tells the story of the ascetic Kausika and the brahmin women (Sdhp.55r.11-58r.2<Mbh.III.197.1-44; with variants, and some additional slokas to be found in the footnotes of the critical edition). 
While Kausika is sitting at the foot of a tree reciting the Vedas, a female crane (or, more probably, egret; balākā) in the branches above inadvertently excretes on him. Kausika is so angry that his thoughts alone cause the bird to drop dead. Filled with remorse, Kausika then goes to a brahmin household to beg for food. The woman of the house welcomes him and is about to give him alms when her husband appears. She at once abandons Kausika (brāh- maṇam vyapahāya tam) and attends to her husband, washing his feet, bringing him a seat, offering him food and drink, and so on. By the time she remembers to bring Kausika his food, the ascetic is furious. 
First, she placates him, explaining that her husband is her greatest god (bharta me daivatam mahat). When Kausika persists in his rage that she should worship her husband before the brahmin guest, she informs him briskly that she is no mere crane (näham balākā; part of a sloka given only as a variant in the Mbh. crit. edn.), unaware of the importance of brahmins. But she has chosen the religious path of devoted service to her husband (patiśuśruşaya dharmaḥ). As a result, she regards her husband as 'the supreme god among all gods', whose law she must fulfil without question.4 It is through the merit she has gained thereby (suśruṣāyāḥ phalam pasya) that she knows all about the incident with the crane. She proceeds to reprove the

Tryambaka's Conclusion

ascetic for failing to control his anger as a true brahmin should. Concluding that he does not really understand what religious duty means (na ... dharmam vetsīti me mațiḥ), she sends him to a hunter (vyādha) in Mithila for further instruction. Suitably chastened, Kausika obeys. 
The story demonstrates Tryambaka's point that, if two duties conflict, service to one's husband comes first. 
In order to stress that no other religious obligation may supersede the wife's primary duty towards her husband, Tryambaka also gives a number of separate quotations taken from a variety of sources (epic, purāna and dharmasastra; Sdhp.58r.2-60r.3). Most of these reiterate or support points raised elsewhere. 
For example, 'there is no separate religious duty, vow or fast' (pṛthagdharmo na vratam napy upoṣaṇam) for a woman other than her devotion to her husband (Sdhp.55r.8-9, 58v.2-3, 58v.5-6; for a discussion of this issue, see sections I (pp.29-43) and IIB (pp. 107-15). The husband is her god and her guru (bharta devo gurur bhartā), religious duty, place of pilgrimage and vow all in one (dharmatīrtha- vratāni ca); hence she should abandon all else and cleave only to him (Sdhp.55r.9-10). Just as sūdras should serve the higher varnas, so women should serve their own husbands; and they should never engage in japa recitation, austerities, oblations, religious donations, vows nor sacrificial ritual as long as their husbands live (Sdhp.58r. 3–5; see section IV, note 8). The auspicious epithets 'she who is devoted to religious duty' (dharmaparamā) and 'she who participates in her (husband's) religious duty (dharmabhāginī) are applied to the ideal wife who 'regards her husband as a god' (devavat...pra- pasyati; Sdhp.59r.4–5); and so on. 
Tryambaka concludes that, through devoted service to her husband, the good wife attains the merit of every religious act that he performs (tenaiva bhartṛkṛtasarvadharmaphalāvaptiḥ; Sdhp. 59v.2ff.). 
Tryambaka in fact goes even further: if her husband requires it, a woman should do even what is normally considered wrong (tadā- jñayā akāryam api kartavyam). This point is also made earlier in a passage attributed to Vijñāneśvara (Sdhp.60r. 1). Tryambaka's evidence is drawn from two well-known stories in the Mahābhārata. First, he quotes at length from the conversation between Pandu and 
 
310 
Stridharmapaddhati 
Kunti on the subject of niyoga (Sdhp.60r.4-61v.6 < Mbh.I.111. 30b-6; 112.3-5, 6b-c, 11-12a, 13-17, 19-28, 30-1; with vari- ants). 
While hunting in the forest, Paṇḍu shoots a deer that turns out to be an ascetic. Since he has been killed in the act of mating, the ascetic curses Pandu that he too will die in the sexual act. Now un- able to father children himself, Pāṇḍu asks Kuntī to find someone to act for him by the ancient custom of niyoga (see section IV, pp.300-2). 
Tryambaka presents Pandu's arguments in favour of the practice but omits Kunti's against it. In order to persuade her to his point of view, Pandu tells her of several virtuous women who have produced sons in this way: Śāradaṇḍāyinī (Sdhp.60r.8-60v.2), Madayantī (Sdhp. 61r.6-7) and his own mother (Sdhp.61r.8). He also describes how Svetaketu made it a sin on a par with foetus-murder (bhrūṇa- hatyākṛtam pāpam) for a woman either to sleep with any man other than her husband or to refuse to conceive a child when ap- pointed to do so by her husband (patyā niyuktā; Sdhp.61r.2-5). The important point, however, is not that niyoga may be within the law (in fact, in section IV, Trymbaka rules that it is not), but that the husband desires it. Twice Tryambaka repeats Pāṇḍu's crucial statement that 'those who know the law know that whatever a husband tells his wife (to do), whether it is lawful or even unlawful, she should do it.'5 
Tryambaka's second illustration demonstrates that when a wife obeys her husband-even if that means doing something that is normally considered wrong (akaryakaraṇe 'pi)—not only is no sin at all incurred (na kevalam doṣābhavaḥ) but, on the contrary, the highest heaven is attained (kim tūttamalokaprāptiś ca; Sdhp.61v. 6-7, with insert). The story of Sudarsana is told here in full (Sdhp. 61v.7-66v.1< Mbh. XIII.2.1-95; with few omissions, some vari- ants). 
In the context of the Mahabharata, as Tryambaka explains, the story is told by Bhiṣma when Yudhisthira asks him if any house- holder has ever conquered Death merely by practising his religious 
5. bharta bharyām rājaputri dharmyam vadharmyam eva va yad bruyāt tat tathā kāryam iti dharmavido viduḥ Sdhp.60r.4-5; 61v.1-2 < Mbh.I. 113.27. 
 
Tryambaka's Conclusion 
311 
duty (dharmam āśritya). The lengthy preamble to the story explains how the beautiful Princess Sudarśanā, born into a noble and royal family, marries Agni and gives birth to Sudarsana. When Sudar- śana marries Oghavatī, he takes a vow that he will conquer Death simply by being a householder (gṛhasthaś cavajeṣyāmi mṛtyum; Sdhp.63v.7< Mbh.XIII.2.40). He tells his wife that there is no more important religious duty for the householder than offering hospital- ity to guests (Sdhp.63v.10-64r.1; cf. section IIC, pp.183–210). Therefore, whether or not he is there himself, she should never refuse a guest anything (atitheḥ pratikūlam te na kartavyam kathamcana), even if it means offering herself (apy ātmanaḥ pradanena; Sdhp.63v. 8-10< Mbh.XIII.2.41–2). 
One day, while Sudarsana is out collecting firewood, a brahmin comes to Oghavatī and asks for hospitality. She greets him in the usual way, then asks what he wants. Despite her attempts to dis- suade him, the brahmin wants only herself (tvayā mamārthaḥ . . . || pradānenātmano... kartum arhasi me priyam; Sdhp.64r.8–10 < Mbh.XIII.2.52-3). Remembering her husband's instructions, Oghavatī agrees. Meanwhile Sudarsana returns from the forest (and calls out to his wife; omitted). Since she is still in the brahmin's arms (lit. 'touched' by them; karābhyām tena viprena sprṣṭā), she does not reply: considering herself polluted (literally 'left-over'), she is ashamed (ucchiṣṭā[s]mīti manvānā lajjitā; Sdhp.64v.4-5 < Mbh.XIII.2.60; for a discussion of ucchişta in the context of 'left- over' food, see section IIC, pp.221-7). The brahmin calls out to Sudarsana to explain. While Death waits poised with his iron club, Sudarśana throws aside anger and jealousy, bids the brahmin welcome, and calls the gods to witness the truth of his vow to offer everything he has to the guest (... tena satyena ... ; Sdhp.64v. 7-65r.9 < Mbh.XIII.2.63-74; cf. Brown 1978). The air resounds with divine confirmations; Death is conquered; and the brahmin turns out to be god Dharma in disguise. Even Oghavati's chastity is restored by Dharma's assurance that she has been perfectly pro- tected by the combination of Sudarsana's virtues and the virtues of a woman who has truly taken the vow of her husband (rakṣitā tvadguṇair eṣā pativratagunais tatha; Sdhp.65v.4-6<Mbh.XIII. 2.80-1). Her reward, as we should have guessed from her name, is that half of her will become immortalized as a sacred river (tradi- tionally the supreme reward for virtuous women), while the other half will attain with her husband all the heavenly worlds normally 
312 
Strīdharmapaddhati 
acquired by austerities (Sdhp.65v.6-10 < Mbh.XIII.2.82–5). 
In the context of the Mahābhārata, the story demonstrates the importance for the householder of honouring the guest (cf. section IIC, pp.183-210). For Tryambaka, it illustrates the lengths to which the good wife should go in her determination to carry out not her own desire but her husband's command (tadäjñayā tu kartavyam akāryam api necchaya; Sdhp.66v.1–2). 
The emphasis on wifely obedience, so graphically illustrated in the last two stories quoted, evidently suggested a potential problem to Tryambaka (Sdhp. 66v.3–67[1]v.10). As he himself explains, he had earlier (pūrvam) declared that the foremost religious duty for women was 'service to one's husband' (patiśuśruṣaṇa; see notel). In the story of Sudarsana, however, 'the most powerful thing is said to be obedience to the (husband's) command' (äjñākaraṇasya prabalyam pratipädyate; Sdhp.66v.4). Is there a contradiction (virodha) here? 
Tryambaka explains at some length that there is not. For 'service' comprises 'every action that gives pleasure to one's husband' (tatprītyutpadanavyāpāraḥ sarvo 'pi suśruṣaiva). Since obedience also gives him pleasure (ājñākaraṇam api prītyutpādanatvāt), it is included in the general term 'service' (śuśruṣāntargatam eva; Sdhp. 66v.9-10). Tryambaka' argues that the writers of dharmaśāstra (śāstrakāra) use the word suśrușă in this sense to cover all actions that give pleasure to someone to whom one owes respect (sarvam api gurujanaprītikaram karma; Sdhp.67[1]r.1-2). With reference to the son's relationship with his mother (cf. Ap.1.10.28.9), the sacrificer is referred to as his mother's son in order to give her pleasure; and that is why Haradatta calls it suśrūṣā (Sdhp.67[1]r.9–67[1]v.1, with insert; cf. Har. on Ap.1.10.28.9-10). Similarly, the 'service' owed by the student to his teacher includes both obeying his commands and administering to his physical needs. Traditionally, however, only three things are specified as the religious duty of the student: service to the teacher, begging for alms, and lighting the sacred fire (ācāryasuśruṣā bhikṣācaranam agnindhanam; Sdhp.67[1]v.4-6). Since 'obedience' (äjñākaraṇa) is included in 'service', it is not mentioned separately. Why then does Tryambaka discuss it sepa- rately? He does so merely to draw attention to a part of the whole, in accordance with the traditional ruling for pleonastic expressions (gobalīvardhananyāyena; Sdhp.67[1]v.9-10; cf. Medh. on Manu VIII.28). Tryambaka's analogy between the student's behaviour 
 
Tryambaka's Conclusion 
313 
towards his teacher and that of the wife towards her husband rein- forces earlier comments to this effect (see sections I, pp.34–9; IIC, pp.168-3, 221-7, etc.). 
To prove his point, Tryambaka relates the story of Svähä and Arundhati (Sdhp.67[2]r. 9-69r.4; Sdhp.67(2)v. 1-69r. 2<Mbh.III. 213.40-214.4a, 5-14; with variants). It is often said that a woman who completely (akhilam) fulfils her religious duty towards her husband 'will be glorified in heaven as an Arundhati among women' (arundhatīva nārīnām svargaloke mahiyate, Sdhp. 67[2]r.9-10; e.g. section IV, p.43, note 43). Tryambaka explains that this is because Arundhati 'served' her husband with great fervour (patiśuśruṣanā- tiśayena). 
The story, as told by Tryambaka, runs as follows. During a a sacrifice, Agni saw the wives of the seven sages and was over- whelmed by lust (kāmavaśam yayau). Realizing this, Agni's wife Svähä resolved to take the form of each of the seven wives in turn in order to make love with Agni herself. With six of the wives she was successful, but she was unable to assume the 'divine form' of Arundhati 'because of the splendour of her austerities and (the supernatural power arising from) her devoted service to her husband' (tasyās tapaḥprabhāveṇa bhartṛśusanena ca; Sdhp.69r.1-2 <Mbh.III.214.14). Van Buitenen's translation of suśruşana as 'faith- fulness' is clearly inadequate here. For the 'fervent service' envisaged by Tryambaka assumes his own broad definition of suśruşana; that is, it includes 'every action that brings pleasure to one's husband.' 
Reminding us that women have no means of atonement (literally, 'austerity'; tapas) other than devotedly serving their husbands (cf. section IV, pp.295–7), Tryambaka relates in full the story of Sāvitrī, the most renowned and best-loved pativrată of all (Sdhp.69r.5-86v. 4; Sdhp.69r.6–86v.3< Mbh.III.277.1-283.16, with variants, and ad- ditional slokas to be found in the footnotes of the critical edition). 
In the context of the Mahabharata, Märkandeya tells the story to Yudhisthira when the latter asks him if there has ever been a wife as devoted as Draupadī. At the end of the story, Mārkaṇḍeya reassures Yudhisthira that Draupadi, like Săvitrī, will save her hus- band. The story itself is so well known that the briefest summary is sufficient here. 
Săvitrī is born to King Aśvapati of the Madra people, by the grace of the goddess Savitri, after he has offered oblations with the 
 
314 
Stridharmapaddhati 
sāvitrī formula regularly for eighteen years. When she grows up, since no man asks to marry her, Aśvapati sends her on a pilgrimage to find a husband. She chooses Satyavat, who lives with his mother and blind father in exile in the forest. Although Savitri learns that he is doomed to die within a year, she marries him anyway and joins the exiled family. As the day of his death approaches, Sāvitrī under- takes the severe tapas of standing day and night for three days. On the fourth day, she accompanies her husband into the forest. When Satyavat collapses and Yama comes to take his soul away, Săvitrī follows, answering Yama with such meek wisdom that he gives her three wishes (always excluding Satyavat's life). She asks first, that her father-in-law will regain his sight; secondly, that he will regain his kingdom; and thirdly, that her own father will have a hundred sons. Given a fourth wish, she asks that she and Satyavat will also have a hundred sons. The fifth wish is given without qualification: Satyavat is freed. 
It is interesting to note that the story of Sāvitrī seems to condone several things that Tryambaka has explicitly and repeatedly con- demned in his treatise. For example, Sāvitrī is evidently not married before puberty since she is adult enough to embark on a pilgrimage alone (cf. the discussion of nagnikā, section IIA, pp.86-8). According to Tryambaka, the pilgrimage itself is prohibited (see sections IIB, pp. 132-41, and IV, p.275, note 7). So, one assumes, is the stubborn- ness with which she refuses to accept her father's initial decision that she should not marry Satyavat (see section IV, p.276, note 9). She undertakes a three-day 'vow' (vrata) that involves severe austerities (tapas) when both vows and austerities are forbidden to her (cf. section IV, pp.275-6, notes 7-8). Instead of submitting to her father-in-law (cf. section IIC, pp.156-7), she ignores his advice to stop her vow. She even answers back to Death, refusing (albeit humbly) to give in to his decree. Yet, by virtue of her devotion to her husband, Săvitrī is praised throughout India even today as the per- fect pativrată. Tryambaka would presumably argue that this merely demonstrates that devotion to one's husband supersedes all other obligations (see above). 
Tryambaka's summary (Sdhp.86y.4-88r.1) 
'The husband is thus to be propitiated (samtoṣaṇīyaḥ, comprising a variety of meanings: giving pleasure, making happy, pacifying,

appeasing, worshipping, etc.) (by the wife as follows): by observing the rules of purification; by attending to the fire ritual; by paying homage to guests; by taking care of household duties; by keeping close watch over the household (accounts), both income and ex- penditure; by attending to her husband's bodily comfort; by serving food to her husband's dependants, etc.; by eating the sanctified remains (prasāda) of (the food offered to) him herself; by love- making and so on at night; by avoiding both those things which are forbidden to her and those which her husband does not like; by putting into practice both those things which are prescribed and those which her husband likes; by adorning herself (pratikarmaṇā; or perhaps "keeping everything tidy"); by driving away her hus- band's fatigue; by putting the religious rulings relating to the body into practice whenever they are appropriate, according to the law; by following her husband (into the fire when he dies); (or, alter- natively,) after her husband('s death), by observing (the appro- priate) restrictions such as celibacy (brahmacaryādi) for as long as she lives; by obedient (or devoted) service to her husband; and by doing what he says. Propitiating him in this way is said to constitute true 'service' to one's husband.'6 
Two points may be noted here. First, despite the rulings that prohibit sahagamana in the kali age (see section IV, pp.295–7), Tryambaka has felt it appropriate to include the practice here. Similarly, despite his own evident approval of sahagamana (see section IV, pp.293-5), he has found it necessary to offer the alter- native of widowhood as well (see section IV, p.304). 
Secondly, Tryambaka continues-even in so brief a final sum- mary—to give greater weight to the husband's opinions and demands than to any independent formulation of the law by dharma- śastra. For example, the wife is required to avoid both 'those things

that are forbidden to her' and 'those which her husband does not like'. Similarly, she should do both 'those things that are prescribed' and 'those which her husband likes'. It is clear from the tone used and the examples given throughout section V that, in each case, the latter requirement is the stronger. Thus she should follow the detailed rules of dharmaśästra unless and until her husband commands her otherwise. As soon as there is any conflict, however, she should simply do as he requires. It is fitting, therefore, that Tryambaka ends his summary with what are for him the two most important rulings for the ideal wife: she should offer her husband 'obedient and devoted service' (with a marked stress on 'obedience', according to Tryambaka's own definition; see above, pp.310-12; and she should do what he says. For this is indeed true 'service'. 
This summary is followed by a number of well-known slokas in hyperbolic praise of the wife who manages to behave as she should. For example, such a woman obtains fame in this world and the same heaven as her husband in the next (patiloka), and 'there is no higher goal than that' (cānuttamām gatim; Sdhp.87r.6). She 'ascends to heaven via the staircase of service to her husband' (sa bhartṛ- śuśrūṣāsopānasvargatim gatā; Sdhp.87v.3). 'Seated in an aerial chariot' (vimānasthā; cf. above, p.306), she is praised by the gods (Sdhp.87v.4). Wherever her foot touches the ground, the earth is purified (Sdhp.87v.4-5). Though afraid of her (bibhyat), the sun, moon, wind and waters deliberately touch her in order to purify themselves (Sdhp.87v.5-6). For her touch is as cleansing and auspi- cious as a dip in the sacred Ganges (gangāvagaha; Sdhp.87v.7-8). 'As a result of the merit obtained by the devoted wife, three sets of three (ancestors) enjoy the pleasures of heaven: three in her father's line, three in her mother's, and three in her husband's too.'7 
Concluding verses and colophon (Sdhp.88r.1-8) 
'In this way, having (first) shuffled (lit. 'churned'; vilody[a]) the vari- ous pronouncements from the smṛtis and the purāṇas together, and (from them) collected the religious duties relating to women— some of them supplied here and there with reasoned pros and cons

Tryambaka's Conclusion 
317 
(vyavastha)—the wise Tryambakayajvan has, at his mother's command (mäträjñayā), recounted them once again in their proper order in this work. By listening to them, may all women (learn to) apply their minds always to (their) religious duty!'8 
'These religious rulings relating to women, which I have heard one by one in śrutil, smṛti] and purāṇa, I have gathered together from here and there to create (this work) in order to make things easier for the doe-eyed ones (mṛgadṛśām; i.e. women). This work of mine is strung together like a necklace out of brilliant pearls accepted (only) after they have been examined from all sides. May it create supreme delight for the mother of the worlds (Pārvatī)!'9 
(Colophon:) "This Guide to the Religious Duties of Women (stri- dharmapaddhatih) was composed by Tryambakayajvan out of af- fection for his teacher Yajñeśa, and in order to please Nrsimha. May it be (taken as) an offering to Lord Krsna!'10 
Several points may be noted here. Tryambaka's allusion to ‘his mother's command' in the first concluding verse recalls a parallel reference in his introductory verses (see section I, introductory verse 3, p.32, note 6). Similarly, his dedication to the goddess Pār- vati in the second concluding verse recalls the more detailed re- ferences to her in those same opening verses (see section I, intro- ductory verses 1 and 2, pp.29-32, notes 2 and 4). Thirdly, as indi- cated in my introduction, Yajñeśa is also the guru of the author of the Dharmākūta; a fact that suggests that Tryambaka and the pandit-minister Tryambakarāyamakhin are indeed the same in- dividual (see pp.10-13). Finally, the reference to Nṛsimha may be an allusion to Tryambaka's elder brother who was renowned as a minister and patron of scholars in his own right (see pp.16–19).
