Early History of the MDS and the origin mythologies contained in it


## Intro
Like all dharma shAstras or books of Hindu Law, the mAnava dharma shAstra (MDS) or the manu smRti is mainly concerned with the regulation of the life of an Indo-Aryan. The dharma shAstras have been extensively studied to understand various aspects of ancient Indian life and have also come under uninformed criticism by the various enemies of the Hindus determined find defects in Hindu thought. 

## Comparison
Rather than assessing the dharma shAstras (DSs) by modern standards and constructs, it would be more appropriate to compare their socially relevant contents against other ancient and medieval law-books. Systems that lend themselves to more or less equal comparisons to the dharma shAstras are vi-diev-dat of the ancient Iranians, the laws of Hammurabi and the imperfectly known Mongolian Yasa of Chingiz Kha’khan. 

## Application
It appears plausible that the laws ordained by the DSs were actually close to practices current during the Mauryan era. They appear to have attained a near pan-Indian distribution[1] in this phase. In the subsequent epochs they appear to have even taken root outside of India in the Far Eastern and Central Asian colonies of the Indians[2]. However, their sway, in these later epochs, particularly during the Gupta and even later Chola periods was largely theoretical, with a more important role for the local laws of the self-governing units within the Hindu empires. Nevertheless, the DSs played an important role in the development of Hindu cultural unity over India.


## Amendments
Unlike the Vedic literature, but more like the itihAsa-purANa genre of Sanskrit literature, the DSs were prone to extensive amendments and corruptions over time. On account of this historical conclusions can be drawn from them only after the various layers present in them are determined and their relative chronology understood. 

## Goal
In this work we shall mainly concentrate on one of the foremost of the dharma shastras, namely that of manu, that contains some additional material beyond the usual concerns of the DSs. The idea here is not to discuss Hindu law, but some historical conclusions that may be drawn from the MDS. 

## kShatriya origin
Most dharma shastras and the related aphoristic dharma sutras have as their authors well known Indo-Aryan encyclopedists such as Apastambha, kAtyAyana, gautama and the like. However, the MDS unlike these is attributed to manu, the legendary ancestor of all the kshatriyas or by some accounts even the legendary common ancestor of all humans or all life forms.



This attribution itself provides an interesting lead regarding the history of the MDS tradition. Vidievdat, the analogous law-book of the ancient Iranians is attributed to Yima Kshaeta (the primal ‘kshatriya’ of the Iranians) the son of Vivahvant. In the Indo-Aryan world manu the primal kshatriya, like yama, is considered a son of vivasvAn. In this context it is interesting to note that the medieval dharma shAstra digests quote a now nearly lost smRti text, the yama smRti[3]. Thus, there is evidence for the parallel existence of a ‘yama’ counterpart of the MDS even amidst the Indo-Aryans. Taken together, it appears possible that the MDS at its core represents an essentially Indo-Iranian tradition wherein the social laws and taboos were attributed to the primal being, the son of vivasvAn. 

## Purity concern
Consistent with this, both the Iranian Vidievdat and the MDS are obsessed with ritual purity and purification of various objects through ablutions and other means. Comparisons between the taboos and practices of the Roman priests- the Flamen dialis and the Indo-Aryan brAhmaNas show a rather precise match[4], suggesting that codification of ritual taboos and priestly behavior had already emerged in the early Indo-European period. This is consistent with the reconstructed word Proto-Indo-European word for a priest *bhragsmen from which brAhmaNa and Flamen are likely to have descended.+++(5)+++ This implies that it is likely that even prior to the Indo-Iranian period there was a body of social laws and institutes of priestly and regal conduct that were already quite well established and constituted what may be called the proto-manu smRti. Given this conclusion can we identify any material in the extant MDS text that may be a remnant of this ancient period?

## Cosmogony
The MDS is rather distinct from number of other dharma texts in providing a cosmogonic origin mythology at the beginning of the text. There are several cosmogonic concepts seen in the Vedic texts are combined together in the MDS. One of these that can be termed puruSha origin myth appears to be a very primitive one, traceable to the PIE period and is considerable interest in this context. The puruSha origin myth is clearly expounded in the puruSha sUktaM (RV 10.90) that in its core consists of the primal being- puruSha gives rise to social order in the earthly plane and cosmic order on the universal plane. This view is remarkably reflected in MDS.31-32:

> laekana< tu ivv&Ï(w¡ muo baøépadt>, äaü[< ]iÇy< vEZy< zuÔ< c inrvtRyt!.
iÖxa k«Tva£AaTmnae dehm! AxeRn pué;ae =-vt!, AxeRn narI tSya< s ivrajm! As&jt! à-u>.

> “For the sake of the growth of the peoples he caused the brahmin, the kshatriya, the vaishya and the shudra to emerge from his face, hands, thighs and feet respectively.  
> Dividing his body in half male and half female; through this he generated virAj”.

In the puruSha suktaM we are told that virAj is the primal puruSha (virAjo adhi pUrushaH). Thus the MDS directly reproduces the puruSha mythology expressed in the RV in addition introduces the concept of the virAj emerging from an androgynous twin form (divdhA kRtva) form the primal being.



This offers a connection with yima-the Iranian counterpart of manu. Yima is derived from the PIE word *yema, meaning twin and is attested in words like Jemini (twin in Greek- via a common y->j transform). Even in the Rgveda, there is a whole hymn where yama is paired with his female twin yamI (RV 10.10). Similarly in Nordic mythology we are told that the primary male- female pair- “realm of frost” (Niflheimr) and “realm of fire” (Muspellheimr) gave rise to the giant primal figure Ymir. Ymir is directly derived from proto-Germanic *Yuminaz and is equivalent to yama or yima. The Roman observer, Tacitus, in his book Germania (chapter 2) describing the mythology of the primitive Germans mentions that the primal twin gave rise to the primal man Mannus (equivalent of manu). Mannus spawned, in turn, the progenitors of the 3 strata of ancient German society- the Ingaevones, Herminones and Istaevones, like the brahmins, kshatriyas and vaishyas. Thus we may conclude that the MDS retains some material from a very ancient stratum of IE existence.



The MDS contains additional cosmogonic material that also have strong parallels in the 10th maNDala of the Rgveda and are well developed only amidst the Indo-Aryans. The first of these is the concept of the origin of the universe from the hiraNyagarbha (MDS-9).

tda{fm! A-vdœ hEm< shöa<zu sm à-m!, tiSm|! j}e Svy< äüa svRlaekiptamh>.

“The seed became the golden egg that glowed with a thousand rays; in that emerged brahmA, out of whom the whole universe has sprung.” This origin myth is referred to in RV 10.121 (hiraNyagrabha sUktaM). These second is the idea of the manifest universe emerging from an un-manifest form in which matter was unstructured in its entirety (MDS 5-6).

AasIdœ #dm! tmae-utm! Aà}atm! Al][m!, AàtKyRm! Aiv}ey< àsuÝm! #v svRt>.

tt> Svy<-urœ -gvan! AVy­ae VyÃyiÚdm!, mha-utaid v&Ä Aaeja> àaÊrasIt! tmaenud>.

“This universe existed un-manifest, unperceived, destitute of structure, un-amenable to probing, un-understandable, wholly immersed, in an inactive state. Then the Self-existent, indiscernible, but comprising all this, the fundamental elements of the

discernible universe, appeared with irresistible power, bursting forth from the darkness.” This is reflected in the origin mythology developed in RV 10.129 (nAsadiya sUktaM), one of the most profound mantras in Hindu literature. All these origin mythology hymns appear in the 10th maNDala of the Rg veda and appear to be part of one of the youngest layers of the RV saMhita that may be associated with the kuru-pa~nchAla realm. The term puruSha, that was coined in the kuru-pa~nchAla period, bears the same relationship with respect to the word pUru as mAnuSha does to manu. As the king pUru was the founding patriarch of the kuru-pa~nchAla ruling class, it is quite likely, that the renaming of the primordial being as puruSha was a move to ‘nationalize’ the ancient Indo-European origin mythology after their dynastic founder. The emphasis of these specific motifs in the MDS suggests that its precursor from the Indo-Iranian period, probably underwent a formalization in the kuru-pa~nchAla realm where it was expanded to include the prevalent origin mythologies and emerged as the principal corpus of Aryan law. This view is strongly supported by the geographical description given in MDS 2.19-2.23 that clearly views the kuru-pa~nchAla realm as the heartland of the Aryans who had settled in India:

“The realm of the kurus, the matsyas, pa~nchAla, and shurasenakas, indeed form the country of the brahmanical sages, which is next to brahmavarta (the land of brahman or mantras that is said to lie between sarasvati and drishadvati). From the foremost men born in that land, let all men on earth learn their etiquettes. This land, that lies between the Himalayas and the Vindhyas mountains, with prayAga in the East and vinashana (the place where the river Sarasvati disappears) to the west, is called madhyadesa. But the entire tract between those two mountains (just mentioned), extending as far as the eastern and the western oceans is region of the Aryans. It is that land where the blackbuck naturally roams, a land fit for the performance of sacrifices; the lands beyond these regions are the regions of the mlecchadeshas”.



Specifically the clans of primary protagonists of the pUru epic, the mahAbhArata, the kurus, the yadus, the pa~nchAlas and the matsyas are mentioned as being present in the core Aryan region. However, in the MDS the principle references to kshatriyas, are to those such as sudAs paijavAna, gAthi, nahusha and vena, who were exalted in the vedic texts, and the brAhmaNas that followed them. Similarly, there is reference to bRbhu, the paNI chieftain and his patronage of the vedic seer bharadvAja, that is alluded to principally in the Rgveda. The mention of these figures, rather than the mahAbhArata heroes or the IkshvAkus, or the Magadhan rulers, suggests that the basic core of the MDS was laid out just prior to the great bhArata war period.



The descriptions of the Aryan king in the MDS are quite close to the primary Indo-European ruler figure and represents monarchy in a state of anterior to that seen in later Hindu texts like the artha shAstra and the panchatantra.  The king in the MDS is repeatedly described as embodying the deities, indra, vAyu, agni, varuNa, yama, kubera, chandra and surya (MDS 5.58, 7.04, 7.07). For example:

#NÔainl ymakaR[am! A¶ez! c vé[Sy c,cNÔ ivÄezyaez! cev maÇa inùRTy zañtI>. (MDS7.04)

“The king is the embodiment of the eternal essences of indra, vAyu (anila), yama, surya (arka), agni, varuNa, chandra and kubera (vittesha).”



In this respect the differs from the later description of the king as an embodiment of viShNu and come closer to the Rgvedic model where great heroes like the IkshvAku monarch, trasadasyu’s regal power is compared to that of indra and varuNa. The Rgveda also emphasizes the nature of agni, varuNa and yama as divine ‘kshatriyas’- their qualities were easily superimposed on the earthly ruler. The king was conceived as an individual concentrating extraordinary qualities: He was supposed to be learned in various texts of statecraft, vedic texts, lore of business and trade and the texts of debating (MDS 7.43).  The king is also called upon to maintain humility, despite his absolute power (MDS 7.40-42). He is also asked to abstain from excesses of alcohol, chess, women and hunting and desist from inflict harm on his people (MDS 7.50-51).



The king of the MDS was along with his brahminical elite was principally concerned with legal issues- the brahmins served as interpreters of the law, prosecutors and the like, while the king served as the ultimate judge and law enforcer, as yama and varuNa in the divine sphere. All other aspects of the state were not directly under the king but relegated to a panel of 7-8 sachivas (ministers). These sachivas were supposed to be experts handling of issues like revenues, budgets, mines, store houses and directly report to the king (MDS 7.54). There were two other specialized posts: 1) the dutaH- who handled foreign affairs and espionage and also served as an ambassador and 2) the amAtya- who was in charge of all internal and external security issues (MDS 7.63-68).  The king is repeatedly advised to construct fortified strongholds, especially hill forts with ramparts protected by archers and make such structures the seat of his power. This clearly appears to be in line with the old Aryan concept of fort warfare and the titles of victorious Aryan rulers like breaker of hostile forts. In terms of warfare clearly the concept of the vyuha or specific battlefield formations dominates. Many of the vyuhas mentioned in the mahabhArata figure in the MDS (MDS 7. 187-189). The vyuhas are also reminiscent of the battle formations alluded to in the Mongol texts were troops were arrayed in particular configuration to allow certain kinds of maneuvers. The king while always participating in battle left actual military preparations to the senApati (commander-in-chief) and balAdhyakshas (generals). Interestingly the MDS insists that the core force should only be made up of men of kuru, pa~nchAla, matsya or yAdava affiliation- again reinforcing the observation that the MDS is essentially a kuru-pancAla text.



These observations taken together suggest that the brahminical priests produced the text at the behest of their kuru patrons, during the pinnacle of their reign in northern India (circa 1500-1400 BC). The first round of redactions probably occurred very shortly thereafter, during the period of peace and prosperity in the reign of the kuru-pa~nchAla monarchs parIkshita and janamejaya (~1300 BC). This period saw a large-scale systematization of a variety of circum-vedic texts and it is very likely that basic form of the MDS we inherit today was laid out in this phase.  Thus, the MDS being one of the principal dharma texts of the smArtas, is not surprising given the central role of the kuru-pa~nchAla empire’s in the emergence of Indian national consciousness.
