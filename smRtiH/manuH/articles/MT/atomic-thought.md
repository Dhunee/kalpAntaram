The presence of atomic thought in the manu-smR^iti

One of the most profound philosophical achievements of the ancient Hindus was the development of the vaisheShika darshaNa or the theory of the particulate structure of all matter. While the principle text of the vaisheShikas is kaNAda’s work, there is clear evidence that the philosophy had a more ancient root in the speculative hymns of the vedic saMhitas (for example Atharva Veda [shaunaka shAkha] 12.1.26, and RV 10.72.6). It is interesting to note that along with the other vedic philosophical and origin-mythological constructs the MDS also presents a scheme for the particular construction of matter (MDS1.15-20):

> “The great one was the only existing entity, bearing the three gunas, that enable the five organs, in their order, to perceive existence.  
> This entity differentiated into 6 types of minute particles, which possess properties without exception, and combined with minute particles of that original entity, gave rise to the elements of all existence.  
> 
> The enlightened ones know the body of the primal entity that constitutes all existence as being framed by those six types of minute particles.  
> 
> Comprised of these basic indestructible particles, the particles of the primary elements, that constitute existence, combine together with their forces and properties. 
> 
> The minute particles of the primary elements, seven in number, known as the purushas of great potential, give rise to various impermanent combinations that comprise the universe, while being indestructible themselves. The properties of the original particles in a combination, and the way in which they combined, influence the properties of the emergent particles.”



While this atomic origin mythology of the MDS may not reach the level of the well argued physical and chemical theories of matter presented in the sutras of kaNada the kAshyapa or the discourses of pa~nchashika the A~Ngirasa and sulabhA the vasiShTha, it does present some basic features of Hindu atomic thought. Importantly, it recognizes the presence of a unified origin of all existence with the structural lay out of the universe attributable to a small set of minute fundamental particles. Further, it recognizes that these particles combine to give rise to the changing universe while remaining more permanent themselves. It also presents the concept of a hierarchy of combination of the basic particles, with the current combination being influenced by the constituent ones. 


The occurrence of the atomistic doctrine with the other more macro-scale origin mythologies in the MDS suggests, that this was one of the streams of origin mythology that developed along with the others in the kuru-pa~nchala realm. Such concepts appear to have been the seeds of the vaisheShika philosophy, that developed parallel to old vedAnta and sAmkhya, which emerged from a different set of seed ideas in the same milieu.
