The MDS, like most other Indo-Aryan cosmogonies envisages all living organisms as emerging from a common ancestor, the prajApati, through several cycles of vertical descent. The MDS notices some kind of hierarchy within which these organisms with a clear suggestion of the division of life into several classes, each containing related life forms (MDS 42-49):

> “I shall describe the classes of creatures in the descending order of their genesis. 
> 
> Cattle, deer, carnivorous beasts with two sets of canines, rakshasas (!), pishachas, and men are one group born alive from wombs. 
> 
> Birds, snakes, crocodiles and tortoises form another group and born from eggs, just like the aquatic animals. 
> 
> Beetles, mosquitoes, lice, flies, bugs, and all their like are one group born from droplets in hot moist places. 
> 
> Diverse small plants, propagated by seed or by slips and shoots, annual plants, which bear many flowers and fruits, and perish after the ripening of their fruits, are the next group. 
> 
> Those trees, which bear fruit without visible flowers are called vanaspati, and those, which bear both flowers and fruit are called vriksha are the next group of plants (All dicots?). 
> 
> Then there are the various plants with many stalks, growing from one or several roots, the different kinds of grasses, the climbing plants and the creepers spring all from seed or from slips. 
> 
> Then there are the organisms (Fungi?), which possess multiform dark appendages; all these as a result of their life forces, possess internal consciousness and experience sensations.”



An important aspect of the MDS is the acceptance of a commonality between diverse life forms animals, plants and others alike. 

Secondly it recognizes a basic similarity in their ability to response to experience various sensations. This unity of all life forms as expounded by the MDS makes itself visible in the taboos regarding meat-eating and expiation of sins for destruction of life forms. 

Explicitly, the killing of an animal by a brahmin solely for the purpose of eating meat is strongly banned by the MDS and violent death is said to be the divine retribution for such acts (MDS 5.37-38).  
Meat from a slaughterhouse, meat of birds, pigs, garlic, onion and leeks are completely banned for a brahmin (MDS 5.11, 5.12, 5.19).  
However, the brahmin may eat the meat of certain animal offered to the gods in sacrifices and whose meat is consecrated in the rites.  
These include the fishes like pathina, rohita,  
mammals like cows, horses, rhinos, porcupines, anteaters and hare,  
and others like monitors and tortoises. 

The MDS adds in a somewhat emphatically that the eating of meat according to the above prescriptions, drinking of alcoholic beverages and enjoyment of sexual pleasures are not sins.  
However, it adds the caveat that abstention from excess brings great rewards nevertheless (MDS 5. 56).  
Thus in the MDS we see an entirely different setup from what we may observe with the more recent Hindus.
